 It s finally game over for Turkey and the F 35 joint strike fighter program after it received a first batch of S 400 Russian made air defense components starting last Friday with Russian military planes continuing deliveries into early this week Turkey s decision to purchase Russian S 400 air defense systems renders its continued involvement with the F 35 impossible a White House statement read The official statement added The F 35 cannot coexist with a Russian intelligence collection platform that will be used to learn about its advanced capabilities Purchased F 35 deliveries from their Lockheed Martin producer had already been held up for the past year as Washington and Ankara exchanged threats over the impending S 400 purchase Up until today it wasn t clear if the Trump administration would follow through on its promise to indefinitely block the transfer Turkey has been a longstanding and trusted partner and NATO Ally for over 65 years but accepting the S 400 undermines the commitments all NATO Allies made to each other to move away from Russian systems the statement continued The Pentagon will also transfer Turkey s industrial participation in the F 35 to other countries by 2020 which will cut major Turkish defense contractors Turkish Aerospace Industries Roketsan and Tusas Engine Industries and others from development on the F 35 platform a loss of an estimated 9 billion over the life of the program However according to Defense News the Pentagon hasn t completely ruled out Turkey rejoining the program should it reverse course on acceptance of the S 400 something not at all likely to happen After in the past week it canceled two press briefings related to Turkey the Pentagon held a rare on camera conference immediately following the White House statement Turkey cannot field a Russian intelligence collection platform in proximity to where the F 35 program makes repairs and houses the F 35 Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition Ellen Lord told reporters Much of the F 35 s strength lies in its stealth capabilities so the ability to detect those capabilities would jeopardize the long term security of the F 35 program We seek only to protect the long term security of the F 35 program
