 Conservative French politicians are outraged over President Emmanuel Macron s suggestion that modern materials like steel titanium and carbon be used in the reconstruction of Notre Dame as the president seeks to fulfill his promise of finishing the project within five years Marine Le Pen leader of the Rassemblement National the right wing party formerly known as the National Front lashed out at her former presidential rival on Twitter Responding to a tweet by French PM Edouard Philippe about an international architectural competition to replace the 19th century spire which collapsed during the fire Le Pen tweeted Touchepasnotredame or hands off Notre Dame TOUCHEPASÃ€NOTREDAME MLP https t co fts5twpxro In his tweet the PM questioned whether the spire should be made out of the same materials or whether it should even be rebuilt at all According to the FT Macron s promise to rebuild the cathedral within five years would probably be impossible if builders had to source season and fit the type of massive oak beams used in the original construction Meanwhile Jordan Bardella a 23 year old rising star of the far right who is leading the RN into the European elections in May mocked the idea of a contemporary roof for the cathedral instead demanding an identical reconstruction while condemning the prospect of some awful piece of contemporary art modern art Bardella told a French television station We have to stop the madness now France s heritage deserves the utmost respect But Le Pen and RN weren t the only ones attacking Macron over his suggestion Laurent Wauquiez leader of the Republicans the party of former prime minister Nicolas Sarkozy also demanded that the reconstruction be identical to the original while Francois Xavier Bellamy the head of his party s list for May s European Parliament elections suggested that Macron and his ministers were guilty of arrogance and haste in trying to second guess experts for the rebuilding of the cathedral As the FT pointed out the controversy echoed the battle over the modernization of the Louvre museum in the 1980s under Francois Mitterrand when glass pyramids were commissioned for the space between two wings of the museum Already French billionaires Apple Inc and a host of others from the private sector have pledged some 800 million 900 million to help restore Notre Dame after the devastating Holy Week fire that destroyed the roof and much of the exterior of the cathedral Though this outpouring of wealth has aggravated members of the gilet jaunes movement who attacked the donors for doing nothing to alleviate the social ills that inspired the movement As the French government which is responsible for the cathedral tries to put together a plan for the reconstruction we imagine these issues will only intensify
