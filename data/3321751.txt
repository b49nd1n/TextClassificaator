 Authored by Mac Slavo via SHTFplan com The censorship continues as a George Soros linked group has joined forces with the mainstream media to ensure climate skeptics are silenced on YouTube The group Avaaz left leaning non profit group published a report on January 16th on its website that claims YouTube is profiting by broadcasting misinformation to millions of people by giving climate denial videos too much prominence Independent mainstream media outlets are engaging in a politically motivated campaign to force YouTube to demonetize and hide any video that denies climate change Regardless of the facts or scientific evidence revealed in the videos if one doesn t submit to the religion of climate change they will be silenced if Avaaz has anything to do about it The report is an undisguised intimidation campaign as not only does it list major advertizers who are running ads on videos that question the legitimacy of the threat climate change poses for humanity but it explicitly calls for them to put pressure on the platform as a means of putting an end to the so called disinformation Despite the findings being published just yesterday many mainstream sites had lengthy articles posted not long after that which featured quotes from those who worked on the report Timings that suggest select websites were given early access making it clear what agenda is being pushed more so as they all tout the same talking points Vice Time Gizmodo The Verge and countless other news entities want YouTube to punish creators who don t toe the correct ideological line The objective is to demonetize and thus censor such individuals as they ll be less inclined to work on the content that they won t be able to profit from RT Nell Greenburg a campaign director at Avaaz claims the report isn t about removing content and censorship however that contradicts the report s own messaging There is a clear attempt to have content hidden as the report calls into question the promotion of such videos in the up next box on the site It s semantics at this point but hiding videos would hurt creators and dissuade them from even trying to share their thoughts It is an indirect way of removing wrongthink The official narrative is the only narrative and when it comes to the domination of others these people want to be at the top Basic human rights are under attack from all sorts of groups And it is fairly safe to say that YouTube will give into the demands of this group silencing and demonetizing anyone caught not parroting the Orwellian narrative the ruling class hands down This situation ultimately raises questions into why anyone or anything should have the power to dictate what others can create Regardless of one s personal views on the matter there s no denying that bold claims have been made about the climate that later were disproven Little is as yet set in stone and content that lands on any one side of the debate should be free to exist If a creator is making videos people are watching their hard work shouldn t be thrown in the bin simply because an activist group with ties to one of the world s richest people and his proxies says so It is not the role of billionaires and their pet projects to play babysitter Sophia Narwitz writer for RT
