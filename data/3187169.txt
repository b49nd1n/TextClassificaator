 To this writer there are in reality but two classifications of evil people A The crazy or deranged evil ones and B The rational without empathy or caring evil ones Just viewed Alan Parker s great 2000 film Angela s Ashes for perhaps the umpteenth time The film is based upon Frank McCourt s autobiography on growing up in Limerick Ireland during the 1930s and 1940s His family was extremely poor during that Depression Era as more of his younger siblings died than lived What got to this writer were the places that the McCourts had to live in during those hard times Dirty dank leaky vermin infested spaces that one would never even ask a pet to live in The continuous Limerick rain would settle in the alley and the main stone floors of their place All the absentee landlord an Irishman like his tenants cared about was getting his rent or out they would go Never to upgrade or even repair the dwellings that he made his money from When the McCourts got behind by a month or two in their rental payments OUT THEY WOULD GO Well that type of person is the Part B classification Rational free of empathy evil We all see the stories of crazed gunmen just unloading on passersby with an automatic killing machine that should never have been sold in the first place Many of those gunmen are most likely insane or at least terribly emotionally disturbed individuals thus my part A classification The part B Rational without empathy evil ones are most likely both the gun manufacturers AND gun retailers who continue to make and sell those WMDs One does not need to hunt for deer with an AK 47 period There is NO sport in the pleasure shooting with an AK 47 Now here comes the topper What about those in government who defend the rights of gun manufacturers and gun retailers to ply their trade Well It does not matter about the legalities of operating in what can and should be construed of as an evil way That aforementioned landlord did not break any laws or operate outside of laws at that time Yet there must be an accountability on moral or humane grounds for how he conducted himself We should take that to the philosophical and spiritual limit and begin categorizing those who know better yet still defend the acts of other evil ones Case in point The invasion of Iraq Anyone and I mean anyone who knew that the Bush Cheney Cabal s information on WMDs by Iraq was false and highly misleading and did NOTHING about it at the time is EVIL Period Anyone in government or the embedded media who finds out that those who lead us have perpetrated a crime and says nothing EVIL There was a guy I knew who seemed like a nice and decent man I recall a few years ago when he was telling me about a telemarketing job he had He laughed and told me that he worked for a guy who said he was in real estate The employer had him cold call lists of people who had their homes up for sale The pitch was to get them to List their homes on his new website that reached millions of prospective home buyers from actual real estate broker lists nationwide He emailed them a brochure that explained things with great graphics etc Then he would call back a few days later and close them on just a 75 fee to be placed on the new site Well the skinny of it all was that there was NO new website If anyone complained they were told that the site was being constructed shortly By the time the new sucker realized it was not happening they had already sold their home and moved on Two evil people the employer and the guy I knew Perhaps if those amongst us who are NOT in either category but won t get pissed off until some evil touches them or their families The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing Edmund Burke Philip A Farruggio is a contributing editor for The Greanville Post He is also frequently posted on Global Research Nation of Change World News Trust and Off Guardian sites He is the son and grandson of Brooklyn NYC longshoremen and a graduate of Brooklyn College class of 1974 Since the 2000 election debacle Philip has written over 300 columns on the Military Industrial Empire and other facets of life in an upside down America He is also host of the It s the Empire Stupid radio show co produced by Chuck Gregory Philip can be reached at email protected
