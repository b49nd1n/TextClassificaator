 Authored by Jennifer Kabbany via The College Fix I m a conservative but my essays are very liberal A survey of 1 000 Republican and Republican leaning college students has found that nearly three quarters of them have withheld their political views in class for fear their grades would suffer The online poll was conducted in late August exclusively for The College Fix by College Pulse an online survey and analytics company focused on college students Only students who self identify as Republican or Republican leaning were polled The question asked Have you ever withheld your political views in class for fear that your grades would suffer Seventy three percent of students who identity as strong Republican reported that they had while 71 percent of students who identify as weak Republican said yes Even students who identify as Republican leaning independents indicated they ve kept quiet 70 percent reported they have withheld their political views to protect their grades Most surveys over the years have found that academia is dominated by professors who identify as liberal or who are registered Democrats With that The College Fix s new poll results indicate that under this atmosphere a large majority of right of center students are concerned that openly disagreeing with their educators will have negative repercussions with only about 30 percent responding they do not withhold their views In the comments section of the survey where students have the option to weigh in on the topic after they ve answered several offered various anecdotes Among them CU Boulder You should be inclusive of everyone s views Ok maybe abortion is bad No not like that Western Kentucky University I wrote a 19 page research paper on a Christian pro life movement I was the only one in the class that when presenting my paper had a surprise visitor who was the teacher s very liberal friend argue with me about their views Notre Dame I actually got yelled at by a professor for my views on gun control It wasn t an argument or anything just plain one sided insulting Clemson When writing papers for gen ed classes Absolutely I know a guy who chose to write a pro border wall argumentative essay for our super liberal professor and the prof just wrote this whole paper is one big fallacy and bombed him Me I wrote about the evils of horse racing Perfectly safe topic UCSD Not for fear of a bad grade But fear of being a social outcast Penn State Well I actually have some different thoughts on that Shut up you racist sexist homophobic xenophobic piece of human garbage UMass Amherst Weird how being forced to hide my libertarian views in class for years just sorta drove me underground and now I m a hyper authoritarian Funny how that works NC State Why would I get myself killed to say I m a libertarian in a philosophy class Auburn I have had grades affected when I didn t withhold my views University of Louisville I am conservative I would be crucified I heard enough horror stories from friends and family to keep my mouth shut and avoid politics in class if at all possible Kansas State Professor the day after the presidential election kicked two students wearing MAGA hats out of class I was appalled We re all people if someone disagrees with you love them anyways Mizzou I m a conservative but my essays are very liberal Arizona State In my sociology class my professor asked us if we would give our child hormone blockers if they believed they were transgender that was the day s lesson One guy said he would rather teach his daughter to love her body the way it is than change it She sat straight up said so you would be a bad parent then What was your name again Then she went to type something on her computer Not a good day for him I m sure Oklahoma State Suuuuper liberal government teacher who only showed Robert Reich documentaries Wasn t gonna speak my opinion around there Alabama Took a honors English class freshman year and I didn t know the topic of the class until it started feminism and sexuality in pop culture If I had shared any of my opinions with that psychotic uber liberal communist professor I guarantee she would have failed me Asked to weigh in on the survey results American University senior Alec Schemmel told The College Fix he is not surprised by them I deal with it every day I see it every day said Schemmel 25 a journalism and political science major He did not take the poll Schemmel who earlier this year wrote an article for The College Fix maintains a personal blog On it he chronicled his experience of receiving his first C grade at American in an interest groups and lobbying class during the spring semester because he contends his professor knew he is conservative and disagreed with his politics His complaints to the dean over the issue were ultimately not resolved in his favor I feel like I am alone in that I am the only person willing to speak up Schemmel told The Fix Some right of center activist groups on campuses across the nation attempt to connect like minded students for support networking education and camaraderie outside the classroom Among them Young America s Foundation Turning Point USA Intercollegiate Studies Institute and the Network of enlightened Women known as NeW Asked to weigh in on the survey Karin Agness Lips president of NeW told The College Fix the results are sad but not surprising We hear from students regularly that their campuses don t foster intellectual diversity Lips said Professors and administrators should be encouraging an environment of free intellectual exchange challenging students not silencing them This makes groups that provide an intellectual home for conservatives all the more important
