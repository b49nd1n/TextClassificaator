 Jamie Fly a former high ranking Bush era neocon believes you shouldn t have the right to post on social media Fly went on to complain that all you need is an email to set up a Facebook or Twitter account lamenting the sites accessibility to members of the general public He predicted a long struggle on a global scale to fix the situation and pointed out that to do so would require constant vigilance write Jeb Sprague and Max Blumenthal This attitude shouldn t come as a surprise Neocons believe they are a special breed the chosen few of an intellectual crème de la crème and the rest of us are merely bread and circus spectators on the sidelines as they forge our collective history and increasingly possible ruin Fly is a research associate at the Council on Foreign Relations He served in the National Security Council and the Defense Department during the Bush presidency He also worked at the Claremont Institute and the American Enterprise Institute Fly tutored presumptive presidential candidate Marco Rubio on foreign policy and he is the former director of the Foreign Policy Initiative a staunch neocon advocacy group founded by arch neocons William Kristol Robert Kagan and Dan Senor He is now a senior fellow and director of the Asia program at the German Marshall Fund an organization funded by the US government and NATO The German Marshall Fund organized the Alliance for Securing Democracy and its Hamilton 68 effort to destroy alternative media under the false and largely debunked claim it is a cutout for Russia and Vladimir Putin who are we are reminded daily dedicated to destroying democracy and taking down the exceptional and indispensable nation Jamie Fly and his coconspirators Laura Rosenberger and J M Berger know the Russians aren t responsible for thousands of alternate media websites and social media accounts They know this phenomenon which began with the birth of the World Wide Web in the mid 1990s is homespun and has absolutely nothing to do with Russia It is their mission to make sure the establishment is free to promulgate its lies and war propaganda without counterbalance and the interruption of truth These folks are digital book burners on par with Nazis who burned books in Berlin on the Opernplatz in May of 1933 Like the Nazis they want to silence those who counter the narrative For the Nazis the targets were communists socialists anarchists and all who opposed fascism while our new book burners liquidators of heresy against the ruling elite are focused on groups and individuals challenging the lies and half truths of the state regardless of ideology For the elite populism and nationalism represent a twin threat to the emerging globalist scheme of a one world government and currency directed by a cadre of unelected bureaucrats and ideologues Donald Trump portrayed himself as a patriot and nationalist Make America Great Again however after the election the same old crowd of CFR operatives Goldman Sachs alumni and hardcore neocons staffed his administration thus making the realization of his campaign promises virtually impossible The ruling elite their functionaries and proxies have declared war on alternative facts that is to say information contrary and even hostile to the narrative While it is true the corporate media has lost some influence it still projects a powerful influence on public opinion especially in the current highly polarized political climate For instance it is now assumed a Trump supporter send bombs to Democrats and this has become a trending topic on social media There is zero evidence a Trump supporter had anything to do with this incident and yet the hashtag MAGABomber has gone viral on social media demonstrating how easily it is to sell lies and fabrications to a polarized public Fly and his digital book burning associates will not stop until the last vestiges of the alternative media are wiped out This process is underway now with a number of popular alternative media websites losing significant traffic following removal from social media As Mr Fly says this is only the beginning They will not stop until the challenge is defeated and the digital information landscape is once again completely in control of the psychopaths at the top and their well paid minions pushing the idiotic lie that Putin and the Russians are responsible
