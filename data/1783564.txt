 Route 91 workers get devices back with videos messages deleted Workers at the Route 91 festival during which Stephen Paddock unleashed his massacre have reportedly been given back their phones and laptops by the FBI only to discover that all messages and videos from the night of the attack have been wiped clean According to a Las Vegas resident who posted a status update on Facebook A bunch of people that worked the Route 91 said they got their cell phones back today They all said that all their phones are completely wiped clean All messages and info from that weekend are completely gone Anyone else experience this A few different people who were vendors there are all saying the same thing the woman later comments Later in the thread a Route 91 worker confirms the story commenting Of course It s an active federal crime scene They can wipe it clean I was the beverage manager for the entire event My laptop is wiped clean Infowars was separately contacted by another individual who told us the same story Both individuals asked that their names not be revealed The fact that all the information relating to the massacre has been deleted is sure to prompt further claims of a cover up While some assert that the feds wiping data is a routine part of their investigation procedure if authorities want to stop the many conspiracy theories circulating about the attack they re not doing a very good job of it As Ann Coulter notes the media s treatment of the story and the constantly changing official narrative is only serving to make people more suspicious I don t know what happened and apparently neither do the cops but it s kind of odd that we keep being told things that aren t true about the Las Vegas massacre from the basic timeline to this weird insistence that Paddock made a good living at gambling writes Coulter She points to many questions that remain unanswered about the attack including why Paddock checked in to the hotel days earlier than authorities first said he did why he was wearing gloves if he planned to commit suicide and why Paddock chose to unload 200 rounds into the hallway at a security guard who was checking on someone else s room before beginning his massacre
