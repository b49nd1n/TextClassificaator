 Trump s attorney Rudy Giuliani tweeted on Saturday that MEK is a viable alternative to the rule of the mullahs in Iran Rudy of course didn t bother to point out that NCRI is a front organization for MEK short for Mojahedin e Khalq the terrorist organization that wants with the help of the neocons to rule Iran Tom Ridge Louis Freeh and Bob Torricelli agree that NCRI National Council of Resistance in Iran is a very capable alternative to the Regime of Terror oppressing Iran for 40 years They stand for freedom pic twitter com xaqzMkdDUS Rudy Giuliani RudyGiuliani July 13 2019 According to research conducted by Ivan Kesić a freelance writer for The Iranian MEK is a terrorist organization on par with the Islamic State Kesić writes that based on the facts and figures due to the terrorist attacks committed by the Mujahedin e Khalq more than 16 000 people have been killed in Iran alone not counting their atrocities against Iranian and Iraqi civilians during the Iran Iraq war and the 1991 uprisings in Iraq Their tactics included bomb attacks targeted assassinations aircraft hijackings and so on Only from 26 August 1981 to December 1982 the MEK conducted 336 terrorist attacks against targets in Iran Americans were not immune from violence according to Kesić Mujahedin e Khalq has also conducted attacks against numerous Western targets both in Europe North America and elsewhere In the early 1970s MEK members killed several US soldiers and civilians working on defense projects in Tehran Such victims included US Army Lt Col Lewis L Hawkins who was assassinated in June 1973 US Army officers Col Paul Shaffer and Lt Col Jack Turner killed in May 1975 an Iranian employee at the US Embassy in Tehran two months later and US civilian contractors Robert R Krongrad William C Cottrell Jr and Donald G Smith assassinated by four gunmen in August 1976 Furthermore in May 1972 US Air Force General Harold L Price was seriously wounded in attempted assassination Several hours later the MEK had a plan to assassinate US President Richard Nixon and they blasted a bomb at mausoleum where Nixon was scheduled to attend a ceremony just 45 minutes after the explosion In November 1970 a failed attempt was made to kidnap the US Ambassador to Iran Douglas MacArthur II MEK gunmen ambushed MacArthur s limousine while he and his wife were en route their house Shots were fired at the vehicle and a hatchet was hurled through the rear window however MacArthur remained unharmed During the same period MEK operatives also committed bombing of facilities of Pan Am Airlines Pan American Oil Shell Oil and of gates of British Embassy Even Wikipedia the establishment s online encyclopedia of spin and historical omission admits NCRI is a front for MEK The organization has appearance of a broad based coalition however many analysts consider NCRI and the People s Mujahedin of Iran MEK to be synonymous taking the former to be an umbrella organization or alias for the latter and recognize NCRI as an only nominally independent political wing or front for MEK Both organizations are considered to be led by Massoud Rajavi and his wife Maryam Rajavi Not surprisingly one of the most ardent Zionists to ever sit in Congress Joe Lieberman supports NCRI cum MEK and likely feeds at same MEK trough as Giuliani None other than establishment propaganda paragon Politico reported the former New York mayor s affection for MEK cash According to a financial disclosure reported on by The New York Times Giuliani has been speechifying at hyperspeed for years collecting 11 4 million for 124 appearances in just one year and that was before signing up for the MeK gravy train around 2011 Perhaps he just didn t have time to consider the character of his paymaster Former
