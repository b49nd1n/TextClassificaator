 Via Greg Hunter s USA Watchdog blog Best selling author Edward Klein s latest best selling book is called All Out War The Plot to Destroy Trump Klein reveals that this plot started in the Obama White House just weeks after Donald Trump won the 2016 election Klein explains Susan Rice was invited to come to a dinner party and give the President Obama a plan and her plan was to unmask the names of Donald Trump associates who had been inadvertently picked up by electronic intercepts by the National Security Agency NSA The names of these Americans were supposed to remain confidential She Susan Rice suggested they would be unmasked meaning they would become public and they would be distributed widely throughout the intelligence community Inevitably therefore she admitted those names would be leaked to the mainstream media MSM and the story would begin that there was collusion between Donald Trump and the Russians This of course was always a fairytale because we have had an investigation going on for more than a year and a half and no one has come up with a scintilla of evidence to prove that She Susan Rice wasn t doing anything illegal but clearly she was doing something unethical to put it mildly because President Obama and his national security advisor were using the intelligence community as a weapon against their political enemy Donald Trump So will anyone be investigated Klein says I honestly don t believe that there is going to be an investigation of Barack Obama the former President I do think however that there is a lot of pressure on Jeff Sessions to investigate Hillary Clinton and her connections with the Russians in commissioning that famous or infamous Russian Dossier that we all know about that accused Donald Trump of all kinds of sexual misconduct and collusion with the Russians almost all of which has been disproved as disinformation from the Russians We do know that she Hillary Clinton actually authorized the purchase of this dossier and used campaign funds to pay her law firm to actually launder that money and use it to buy this dossier That s against the law because you are supposed to acknowledge and say what your campaign funds are used for and they are supposed to be used only for the campaign Another big bomb Klein drops in his new book All Out War is his publishing of FBI documents warning of violence coming from Antifa and other left wing groups which Democrats support Klein says In the FBI report that I have reproduced in full in my book it says that these violent left wing groups traveled to Europe met with representatives of al Qaida and the Islamic State or ISIS They also went to Syria and got bomb making instructions and toxic chemical instructions The FBI has followed these people and continue to follow these people now that they are back in America and the FBI believes that when the 2018 mid term elections come things are going to get hotter and hotter in this country politically and that these groups are going to become more and more violent The FBI has said in this document I have in this new book that these left wing groups like Antifa represent the greatest threat to law enforcement since the 1970 s and the Weather Underground Full interview below
