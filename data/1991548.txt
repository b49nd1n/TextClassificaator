 When President Trump on 6 December 2017 declared unilaterally Jerusalem as the capital of Israel to where the US Embassy shall relocate he violated UN Resolutions international law common sense and went against all diplomatic efforts to eventually bring peace to the region not to speak about 130 countries that have already voiced opposition to such a decision And this before the Peace Process is coming to an end at which point the 1993 Oslo Peace Accords would play out They are also called the Road Map for Peace between Palestine and Israel which foresees a two state solution and accordingly a mutual decision on Jerusalem becoming the capital city for both Palestine and Israel These Oslo Peace Accords are still valid today But Mr Trump may not have a clue that such a Peace Accord even exists And his handlers obviously had no interest of telling him And even if they did it would make no difference because the exceptional nation has no scruples demolishing any agreements of the past regardless whether or not it the US of A were party to the shaping of them See also the Iranian Nuclear Deal By the same token Washington does not give a hoot about international law and UN Resolutions We are talking about the only and perfect rogue state the world has known in the past two centuries by far surpassing actually without any comparison with the western customarily accused villains like Zimbabwe North Korea Iran Syria Venezuela Cuba and all those that refuse to bend to the Chief Rogue State the United States of America In fact what Trump has done was just confirming what previous US Administrations had already as an objective namely following the so called Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995 with which the US Congress already 20 years ago requested and prepared this step by legislation that says Since 1950 Jerusalem is the Capital of the State of Israel Never mind and of course not reported by the mainstream media that immediately after promising the US Embassy would be moved to Jerusalem Trump signed a waiver postponing the move indefinitely or until the international situation becomes clear er Who does the US Congress think they are God the Almighty To decide over the Holy City Jerusalem the historic center of the three religion monotheist culture of 5 000 years of Judo Christianism also incorporating Islam is an act of arrogance without comparison This insensitive Trump decision or affirmation at this point in time another one in his basket of disasters brought everything else but peace to the region and especially to Palestine It caused unrest angry demonstrations from people who are basically fighting with their bare hands protests which were immediately oppressed with firepower and violence by the Israeli military and police force killing people in the Israel imposed ghetto of Gaza and the West Bank i e in Palestine what should become an independent state Instead of bringing peace Trump killed the aspiration of peace he de facto killed the notion of a two state solution and he effectively isolated the US from literally the rest of the world Was this a bold provocation inspired by Trump s Zionist masters a trial balloon to find out how much of impunity the world would tolerate At no time was even mentioned that Jerusalem if anything might also be the capital of Palestine The Motherland of Israel let s not forget Palestine was ignored Palestine was provoked into protests just to be brutally suffocated by the Israeli defense Forces IDF They do this with sadistic pleasure like killing helpless flies All this prompted by the criminal and irresponsible behavior of the President of the United States the exceptional Nation or rather his invisible handlers behind the throne But the propaganda mantra must go on the lie that declaring Jerusalem the capital of Israel was good for the Middle East was good for peace was and still is repeated over and over again like a mantra tras mantra tras mantra by Trump and his mannequins his foreign affair puppets Rex Tillerson and Nikki Haley who is masquerading as Washington s UN Ambassador repeating over and over again the same lie the same lie the same lie in the hope as the common saying goes after Goebbels Hitler s Propaganda Minister if repeated enough the lie becomes the truth Do these clowns really believe that if a world renown repeat liar keeps repeat lying the globes populace believes that the repeat lie becomes the truth The people at large have moved forward towards awakening since the horrendous murderous lies about Iraq with weapons of mass destruction that weren t about Gaddafi horrors committed to his people which he didn t to the contrary he provided them with free education health services and cutting edge medical facilities with free infrastructure and a broad social safety net or UN proven lies about Bashar Al Assad s poison gas used against his own people the lies about Iran s nuclear program that never was the lies about Russia s meddling in Ukraine when it is now amply proven that the Maidan massacre was planned and carried out via the US Embassy in Kiev and through US and NATO military and paid mercenaries the lies about the US and NATO fighting against ISIS which Washington created and the list of lies go on endlessly The entire vassal state of the European Union country after country led by the three Ms Germany s Merkel France s Macron and the UK s May have said they would not go along with Trump s decision and moving their Embassies to Jerusalem Bravo Will this decision last or will there be some high power arm twisting by Washington Is Washington still able to do arm twisting economic sanctions Haven t they noticed yet that the west even the hitherto puppet West is gradually but surely moving away from the Atlantic Alliance towards the East Probably for purely selfish economic and financial reasons though some western politicians may look deeper and see the light what I call the Future is in the East What is also mazing though is that nobody seems to even question the basics the right of the self styled emperor Trump the typical emperor without cloths intervening with the decision of another nation s capital city Of course we know that Trump s buddy and family friend Bibi Netanyahu holds and or twists arms smilingly with the Donald on Jerusalem through the infamous family relations of the two warrying aggressors and through the seemingly unbeatable Zion power the western world is being subjected to Trump with this unwise decision may have brought Jerusalem back to the 12th Century the ages of the Crusades when in 1187 on behalf of the Muslim Ayyubids Dynasty Sultan Saladin a Sunni Muslim of Kurdish origins besieged and eventually re conquered the so called Christian Kingdom of Heaven invaded and stolen by the Christian emperors of Rome two hundred years earlier Perhaps Mr Trump nilly willy has started a new Arab Crusade against the artificially imposed Kingdom of Israel artificially implanted in the land of Palestine implanted by the Zionists who used the power of the British Empire which at that time was colonizing Palestine to corrupt the freshly created UN system in 1948 to cut up and destroy Palestine see the Balfour Declaration The British Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour wrote on 2nd November 1917 hundred years ago to Lord Rothschild a leader of the British Jewish community suggesting the carving up of Palestine the creation of a State of Israel The proposal was to be transmitted to the Zionist Federation of Great Britain and Ireland Lord Rothschild was co drafter of the letter The text of the declaration was made official by publication in the media on 9 November 1917 The idea was eventually carried out by a UN Resolution in 1948 bringing about the State of Israel on 14 May 1948 the day Palestine became a non country and enslaved to Israel Behind the Trump strategy lays a broader objective the creation of a Greater Israel that would stretch from the Euphrates to the Nile cutting through Saudi Arabia absorbing Jordan a large portion of Syria and most of Egypt s Sinai Peninsula This is to make Israel a Middle Eastern super power sitting on a huge junk of the sub continent s energy wealth and on most of the Middle east s fresh water reserves on behalf of the Anglo Zionist Empire It is yet to be seen whether this bold and aggressive move by Trump went a step too far whether this impunity is the straw that may break the empire s back What if nobody not even the traditional allies participates in this nefarious endeavor to move their embassies from Tel Avia to Jerusalem What if sanctions that Washington undoubtedly may dish out to those who do not obey its orders do no longer work What if this Trump lunacy opens the gates to the East even further for all those who have been fed up with the empire s financial fury and fire and propaganda crusades to conquer the world and that this Washington
