 Authored by Lance Roberts via RealInvestmentAdvice com I have been slammed with emails over the last couple of days asking the following questions What just happened to my bonds What happened to my gold position shouldn t it be going up Why are all my stocks being flushed at the same time As noted by Zerohedge Stocks down Bonds down credit down gold down oil down copper down crypto down global systemically important banks down and liquidity down Today was the worst day for a combined equity bond portfolio ever In December 2008 we warned of the risk At that time the market was dropping sharply and Mark Hulbert wrote an article dismissing the risk of margin debt To wit Plunging margin debt may not doom the bull market after all reports to the contrary notwithstanding According to research conducted in the 1970s by Norman Fosback then the president of the Institute for Econometric Research there is an 85 probability that a bull market is in progress when margin debt is above its 12 month moving average in contrast to just a 41 probability when it s below Why then do I suggest not becoming overly pessimistic For several reasons 1 The margin debt indicator issues many false signals 2 There is insufficient data 3 Margin debt is a strong coincident indicator I disagreed with Mark on several points at the time But fortunately the Federal Reserve s reversal on monetary policy kept the stock market from sinking to levels that would trigger margin calls As I noted then margin debt is not a technical indicator that can be used to trade markets Margin debt is the gasoline which drives markets higher as the leverage provides for the additional purchasing power of assets However that leverage also works in reverse as it provides the accelerant for larger declines as lenders force the sale of assets to cover credit lines without regard to the borrower s position That last sentence is the most important and is what is currently happening in the market The issue with margin debt in terms of the biggest risk is the unwinding of leverage is NOT at the investor s discretion It is at the discretion of the broker dealers that extended that leverage in the first place In other words if you don t sell to cover the broker dealer will do it for you When lenders fear they may not be able to recoup their credit lines they force the borrower to either put in more cash or sell assets to cover the debt The problem is that margin calls generally happen all at once as falling asset prices impact all lenders simultaneously Margin debt is NOT an issue until it is When an event occurs that causes lenders to panic and call in margin loans things progress very quickly as the math becomes a problem Here is a simple example If you buy 100 000 of stock on margin you only need to pay 50 000 Seems like a great deal especially if the stock price goes up But what if your stock drops to 60 000 Suddenly you ve lost 40 000 leaving you with only 10 000 in your margin account The rules state that you need to have at least 25 percent of the 60 000 stock value in your account which is 15 000 So not only do you lose 40 000 but you have to deposit an additional 5 000 in your margin account to stay in business However when margin calls occur and equity is sold to meet the call the equity in the portfolio is reduced further Any subsequent price decline requires additional coverage leading to a death spiral until the margin line is covered Example 100 000 portfolio declines to 60 000 Requiring a margin call of 5000 You have to deposit 5000 or sell to cover However if you don t have the cash then a problem arises The sell of equity reduces the collateral requirement requiring a larger transaction 5000 25 requirement 20 000 With the margin requirement met a balance of 40 000 remains in the account with a 10 000 margin requirement The next morning the market declines again triggering another margin call Wash rinse repeat until broke This is why you should NEVER invest on margin unless you always have the cash to cover As I discussed previously the level we suspected would trigger a margin event was roughly a 20 decline from the peak If such a decline triggers a 20 fall from the peak which is around 2340 currently broker dealers are likely going to start tightening up margin requirements and requiring coverage of outstanding margin lines This is just a guess it could be at any point at which credit risk becomes a concern The important point is that when it occurs it will start a liquidation cycle as margin calls trigger more selling which leads to more margin calls This cycle will continue until the liquidation process is complete The Dow Jones provided the clearest picture of the acceleration in selling as margin calls kicked in The last time we saw such an event was in 2008 Unfortunately FINRA only updates margin debt with about a 2 month lag Mark s second point was a lack of data This isn t actually the case as margin debt has been tracked back to 1959 However for clarity let s just start with data back to 1980 The chart below tracks two things The actual level of margin debt and The level of free cash balances which is the difference between cash and borrowed funds net cash As I stated above since the data has not been updated since January the current level of margin and negative cash balances has obviously been reduced and likely sharply so However previous market bottoms have occurred when those negative cash balances are reverted Given the extreme magnitude of the leverage that was outstanding I highly suspect the reversion is yet complete The relationship between cash balances and the market is better illustrated in the next chart I have inverted free cash balances to show the relationship between reversals in margin debt and the market Given the market has only declined by roughly 30 to date there is likely more to go This doesn t mean a fairly sharp reflexive bounce can t occur before a further liquidation ensues If we invert margin debt to the S P 500 you can see the magnitude of both previous market declines and margin liquidation cycles As stated this data is as of January and margin balances will be substantially lower following the recent rout I am just not sure we have squeezed the last bit of blood out of investors just yet I warned previously the idea that margin debt levels are simply a function of market activity and have no bearing on the outcome of the market was heavily flawed By itself margin debt is inert Investors can leverage their existing portfolios and increase buying power to participate in rising markets While this time could certainly be different the reality is that leverage of this magnitude is gasoline waiting on a match When an event eventually occurs it creates a rush to liquidate holdings The subsequent decline in prices eventually reaches a point that triggers an initial round of margin calls Since margin debt is a function of the value of the underlying collateral the forced sale of assets will reduce the value of the collateral triggering further margin calls Those margin calls will trigger more selling forcing more margin calls so forth and so on That event was the double whammy of collapsing oil prices and the economic shutdown in response to the coronavirus While it is certainly hoped by many that we are closer to the end of the liquidation cycle than the beginning the dollar funding crisis a blowout in debt yields and forced selling of assets suggests there is likely more pain to come before we are done It s not too late to take actions to preserve capital now so you have capital to invest later As I wrote in Tuesday s missive When Too Little Is Too Much With our risk limits hit and in order to protect our clients from both financial and emotional duress we made the decision that even the reduced risk we were carrying was still too much The good news is that a great buying opportunity is coming Just don t be in a rush to try and buy the bottom I can assure you when we ultimately see a clear risk reward set up to start taking on equity risk again we will do so with both hands And we are sitting on a lot of cash just for that reason You can t buy low if you don t have anything to buy with
