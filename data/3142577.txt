 Contrary to what you may have read elsewhere with virtually all S P 500 companies having reported Q2 results earnings growth is tracking at a negative 75 bps according to Morgan Stanley a lackluster growth rate which further supports the bank s call for an earnings recession which it defines as two or more quarters of flat or negative growth in 2019 Negative earnings growth within the index is also broad 6 of 11 sectors are seeing negative growth this quarter with Materials Industrials and Tech faring the worst Health Care and Financials are experiencing the strongest growth but it is only in the single digits and with the yield curve inverting it is only a matter of time before US banks slide into earnings recession as well Meanwhile the ever bearish Morgan Stanley is gearing up for similar results in the back half of the year as companies reckon with tariffs labor cost pressure eroding margins and excess inventory Meanwhile sales growth has also been sluggish this quarter if positive with S P growth up 3 9 year over year This is a far cry from the robust sales growth we saw throughout 2017 and 2018 That said revenue growth is in negative territory in 4 sectors The sectors seeing the strongest revenue growth are Communication Services and Health Care however the rising margin compression suggests that labor and wage costs are now aggressively eating away at the bottom line So with earnings now negative for two consecutive quarters at least as calculated by Morgan Stanley other banks surprisingly still show a modest increase it is probably not surprising that as has been the story of the year multiples continued to drive the market which is up 15 YTD rather than estimate changes As we reported at the time in July the S P 500 rose 1 3 entirely driven by P E expansion on dovish central banks But as Bank of America calculates following the recently announced 10 tariffs on additional Chinese goods and looming recession risks the P E fell over 5 so far in August to 16 1x Yet even with the drop the market s multiples on earnings look elevated relative to history although there is one metric by which stocks look particularly attractive in the new low rate environment 60 of S P 500 stocks dividend yields eclipse the 10 year treasury yield Subjective and generally irrelevant dividend comparisons aside as bonds and stocks are worlds apart when it comes to their risk profile to allow readers to decide for themselves whether stocks are massively overvalued and overbought or perhaps cheap compared to the world s biggest bond bubble here is a breakdown of the S P 500 across a wide variety of valuation measures proposed by Bank of America 20 in total What the analysis shows is that of 20 metrics the S P is overvalued based on 18 by as much as 92 on a historical market cap to GDP basis and up to 114 if looking at the S P in WTI terms and is cheap only according Price to Free Cash Flow 23 8x vs 28 0x which however is a function of ultra low interest rates and also based on a ratio of Trailing 2 cheap but not Forward PEG multiples The above analysis is only relevant if the US economy fails to slide into a recession which is certainly not guaranteed As a reminder Rabobank last week calculated recession odds at an all time high 81 while BofA s own economists now forecast a 1 in 3 chance of an economic recession in 2020 which is usually accompanied or preceded by an EPS recession Historically the median peak to trough EPS decline during EPS recessions was 21 which points to a trough S P EPS of 129 78 if we start to see earnings decline from here This means that the market is currently trading at 22x this implied trough EPS the most expensive valuation since the Tech Bubble We are confident that everyone remember what happened next
