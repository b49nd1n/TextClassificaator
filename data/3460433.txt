 Former U S President Barack Obama is coming under increasing pressure led by what President Donald Trump is calling Obamagate This comes as Mexico has requested to finally clarify the affair with the secret sale of American weapons to Mexican drug cartels Mexico is asking for the case to be clarified after almost ten years In this secret operation conducted by the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives weapons from the U S were sold to Mexican drug cartels The U S claimed that about 2 000 automatic weapons were sold to Mexicans so that the Barack Obama administration could follow their path to the drug cartels Instead these weapons were used in massacres Mexican authorities are now seeking answers from the United States In addition to selling weapons to Mexican drug cartels Obama is responsible for a lot of global upheaval on the world stage primarily the so called Arab Spring that should be more accurately described as the Arab Winter as it brought death and destruction across the Arab world The sale of these weapons to Mexican drug cartels is another ugly legacy of Obama s rule that liberals like to view as one of the best periods of American history Let s not forget that in 2009 Obama won the Nobel Peace Prize for his apparent extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between people The majority of U S media will most likely try and find appropriate excuses so they can minimize Obama s role in these scandals It is completely clear that the battle over who will be in the White House in the next four years is now taking focus on the Obama era as of opposed to Trump s mishandling of the coronavirus pandemic that has claimed the lives of over 80 000 Americans and infected more than 1 3 million people With endless tweets by Donald Trump dedicated to Obama over the past few days it is as if the presidential battle in November will be fought between him and Obama and not Democrat —Åandidate Joe Biden The reason for Trump s many tweets against the former president was because of Obama s private conversation that was leaked to the public in which he criticized the suspension of the investigation against Trump s former national security adviser Michael Flynn while he called Trump s fight against the coronavirus epidemic a chaotic disaster The American president started tweeting on the morning of May 10 and stopped late in the evening making over a hundred tweets against Obama This exchange between Obama and Trump is not common in American politics as former presidents usually do not interfere in the politics of their successors However there are suggestions that Obama still has connections to the deep state and is actively undermining Trump Obama who openly admitted he would remain active in politics and wished he could contend for a third term could be exerting influence through Hillary Clinton and Biden It is likely Obama is becoming more public as Trump s opponent Biden is proving inadequate and incapable of defeating Trump The battle between Obama and Trump started with the announcement that the Ministry of Justice is terminating the investigation against former Trump s national security adviser Michael Flynn Flynn who was probably the shortest serving national security adviser in history was sacked at the beginning of his term on charges of lying to Vice President Mike Pence about talks with the Russian ambassador to Washington His removal triggered a chain of failed investigations and campaigns against Trump and his alleged links to Russian interference during the U S presidential election which also ended in a failed impeachment In private conversations that leaked to the public Obama described Flynn s acquittal as a threat to the rule of law Trump also retweeted statements from CIA agent Buck Sexton in which he accused Obama of sabotaging the Trump administration in the first days of his term Sexton also called former FBI Director Andrew McCabe a dishonorable partisan scumbag who has done incalculable damage to the reputation of the FBI and should be sitting in a cell for lying under oath Trump then continued with accusations on Twitter and said that Obama committed the biggest political crime in American history by far and ended briefly with Obamagate As for the affair with the secret operation of selling weapons to Mexican drug cartels journalists of Forbes in 2011 wondered whether that operation would become Obama s Watergate and it appears that it very well could be Obama s attempts to smear Trump has not only backfired but it could have very serious legal ramifications against him and others in his administration Note to readers please click the share buttons above or below Forward this article to your email lists Crosspost on your blog site internet forums etc This article was originally published on InfoBrics Paul Antonopoulos is an independent geopolitical analyst
