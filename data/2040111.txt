 A MAN who was wrongly jailed for rape has spoken out of the years of hell that only ended when his family managed to find deleted Facebook messages that proved his innocence Danny Kay of Derby UK spent more than two years behind bars after police relied on an edited and misleading conversation between himself and his accuser with cops now reviewing just how they got it so wrong Mr Kay told The Mail On Sunday he had trusted the system would find the truth after he was arrested on suspicion of rape in 2012 but was instead brought to trial and eventually convicted The now 26 year old said Even now with the conviction quashed I still can t believe that it took years of pain and stress for this nightmare to end And the terrifying thought is that if the police and justice system could fail me like this it could happen to anyone It wasn t until his sister in law Sarah Maddison checked his Facebook account and was able to find the full archived conversation which supported Mr Kay s version of events that his appeal could be set in motion
