 With the recruitment of novice French President Emmanuel Macron the US Israel lobby can now boast a powerful political agent inside the corridors of power of the Élysée Palace to liaise with those agents already resident in the British Parliament and at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue Washington It is of course no small achievement to have managed to recruit half of the European Union as well as the United States Senate to support the dispossession of five million indigenous Arabs who have populated the West Bank East Jerusalem the Golan Heights and Gaza for over a thousand years No small achievement of the powerful minority Zionist movement of America to enforce its political agenda upon the United Nations Assembly in direct violation of UN Security Council Resolution 2334 Hiding behind the usual accusations of antisemitism the US Zionist movement is now in a position to control EU foreign policy as well as that of America through the new French President the British Prime Minister CFI and the US Congress AIPAC together with the tacit approval of Germany s Angela Merkel who has already supplied Israel with a fleet of submarines now armed with nuclear cruise missiles Not a bad achievement for a neo colonial minority political Zionist movement in the 21st century So what would be the likely consequence in the event of Political Zionism succeeding in its expansionist agenda 1 Under the pretext of a future pre emptive strike against Hezbollah US backed Israeli forces are expected to attack both Lebanon and Gaza in order to occupy and control the entire Eastern Mediterranean seaboard from Rafah to Beirut a coastline of some 312 kms 194 miles in length 2 The next objective of the Greater Israel project would be to consolidate all the land up to and including the Jordan River in the East to Eilat in the South Beirut in the North and the Mediterranean in the West This would entail the forced displacement of millions of Lebanese Gazan and Jordanian citizens as well as the original Palestinians to neighbouring states plus the expropriation of their land and wealth by turning the population into refugees within their own countries countries now occupied by Political Zionist migrants from Europe FSU and America However such a Greater Israel project can only end one way and that is in a nuclear war which is not an existential threat that the Macron presidency or the EU should facilitate because gamma radiation recognises no borders Note Greater Israel a nuclear armed US aided Zionist state with an agenda to confront Iran and Turkey for regional hegemony Intended eventually to extend from the Euphrates to the Nile by gaining control of large areas of Lebanon Jordan Syria and Iraq plus the Sinai Peninsula and the Eastern Mediterranean from Cairo to Beirut
