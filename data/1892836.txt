 William Binney is the former National Security Agency NSA official who created NSA s mass surveillance program for digital information He says that if the Russian government had conspired with Trump hacked the Democratic National Committee s computer or in any way influenced the outcome of the last US presidential election the National Security Agency would have the digital evidence The fact that we have been listening to the unsubstantiated charges that comprise Russiagate for more than one year without being presented with a scrap of evidence is complete proof that Russiagate is entirely fake news The fake news originated with CIA director John Brennan and FBI director Comey conspiring with the DNC in an effort to discredit and unseat President Trump and at a minimum prevent him from damaging the vast power and profit of the military security complex by normalizing relations with Russia Consider what this means The directors of the CIA and FBI made up a totally false story about a newly elected President and fed the lies to the presstitutes and Congress The presstitutes never asked for a drop of evidence and enlarged the Brennan Comey lie with a claim that all 17 US intelligence agencies had concluded that Russia had interfered In actual fact a handful of carefully selected people in three of the agencies had prepared perhaps under duress a conditional report that had no evidence behind it That it was fake news created to control President Trump was completely obvious but corrupt security officials corrupt senators and representatives a corrupt DNC and corrupt media used constant repetition to turn a lie into truth Here is Binney See this also Having shoved Trump into the militarist camp his enemies have turned on Trump as an unstable volatile person who might push the button Senator Bob Corker R TN and Senator Chris Murphy D CT are using the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to portray President Trump as a quixotic person who shouldn t have his finger on the nuclear button We have gone full circle from Trump who wants to defuse nuclear tensions to Trump who might push the button If Senators Corker and Murphy were really concerned and not just orchestrating a new way to attack Trump they would bring out the fact that Russiagate is a hoax that has made nuclear war more likely As I have pointed out Washington has convinced Moscow that Washington is planning a surprise nuclear attack on Russia and also collecting Russian DNA for a tailored Russian specific bio weapon I cannot think of anything more likely to trigger nuclear war than the escalated tensions that Russiagate is preventing Trump from reducing See this For the record contrary to the erroneous assertions of nuclear experts the president cannot simply order a nuclear attack The president either has to accept a Joint Chiefs war plan and order a launch when the military is ready or he has to accept the advice of his national security adviser to launch in retaliation for incoming enemy ICBMs If a president simply ordered a nuclear strike he would be ignored If it is not the president who must make the nuclear decision who is it to be The military We should be thankful that that was not the case when the Joint Chiefs pressured President John F Kennedy to approve a nuclear attack on the Soviet Union The question who should have launch authority is an easy one to answer No one If nuclear missiles are incoming launching does not protect you You are already going to be destroyed Why destroy the other side of the world in an act of revenge It is pointless There is no such thing as a preemptive strike that prevents retaliation Nuclear war is an act of insanity Nothing can justify it The purpose of diplomacy is to prevent war However ever since the Clinton regime attacked Serbia US diplomacy has been used to cause wars During the 16 years of George W Bush and Obama the US destroyed in whole or part seven countries killing and maiming millions of peoples and producing millions of refugees Not a single one of these wars was justified Everyone of these wars was based in lies The last US government that showed any respect at all for truth was the George H W Bush administration Before launching each of these acts of unprovoked aggression Washington demonized the leader of the country To get rid of one person Washington did not flinch at murdering large numbers of people and destroying the infrastructure of the country This tells you that Washington has no morality None Zilch Therefore Washington is capable of launching a preemptive nuclear strike Back when nuclear weapons were puny by today s standards Washington nuked two Japanese cities while Japan was trying to surrender That was in 1945 a lifetime away Whatever bits of morality that still existed then are long gone today Today a CNN editor at large named Chris Cillizza published online an article titled There s a massive moral vacuum in the country right now At last I thought a presstitute has realized that Washington s constant nuclear threats against other countries shows a complete disrespect for the life of the planet and indicates a moral vacuum But no the presstitute is talking about sexual harassment especially that of Roy Moore in the 1970s And it is all Trump s fault How can he lead when he harasses women himself President Trump intended to normalize relations with the other major nuclear power He has been prevented from doing so by the military security complex the DNC and the presstitutes Cillizza says sexual harassment is a very big consequence of Trump s election I am left wondering if CNN s editor at large considers nuclear war to be as serious as sexual harassment This article was originally published by Paul Craig Roberts
