 Given it s now Dec 26 in Korea it looks like Kim Jong Un s promised Christmas gift or what many thought would be a long range missile test never arrived Perhaps this was the actual gift in the most optimistic scenario a softening of tensions and willingness to back down in the hope that nuclear talks would warm in this holiday season headed into 2020 However it s not too late for some kind of late present brought by Santa Kim given the following provocative US action on Christmas Day no less as the Pentagon was likely closely monitoring to see if a gift was being readied on the ground via The Hill The United States flew four surveillance planes over the Korean peninsula Wednesday according to an aviation tracker South Korea s Yonhap news agency reported The U S flew four aircraft the RC 135W Rivet Joint E 8C RQ 4 Global Hawk and RC 135S Cobra Ball over the country between Tuesday and early Wednesday The planes were believed to have carried out missions in and around the Korean Peninsula Yonhap reported Yonhap further called the flyovers unusual and said it shows Washington took Pyongyang s threatened Christmas surprise seriously Per the report Military sources confirmed to the news outlet that South Korea and the U S have strengthened efforts against the possibility of North Korea firing an ICBM or other weapons We re keeping a close watch over military moves in North Korea said one of the sources who the outlet declined to name On Tuesday just ahead of Christmas celebrations at Mar a Lago President Trump held out hope the gift could turn out to be something positive Let s see what happens Everybody s got surprises for me but let s see what happens I handle them as they come along Trump told reporters We ll see what happens Trump added Maybe it s a nice present maybe it s a present where he sends me a beautiful vase as opposed to a missile test But who knows just how North Korea will interpret the Christmas Day spy plane flyover Perhaps Kim will take it as a sign of bad faith and will determine a potential belated holiday gift accordingly
