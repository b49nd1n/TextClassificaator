 Authored by Ryan McMaken via The Mises Institute The US Census Bureau released new poverty data this month and California once again has the nation s highest poverty rate according to the Supplemental Poverty Measure According to the SPM California s poverty rate in 2018 was 18 1 percent followed by Louisiana with 16 5 percent and Florida with 16 2 percent The states with the lowest poverty rates per the period were Iowa at 6 7 percent Minnesota at 7 percent and Kansas at 7 8 percent The 2018 report shows a slight general decline in poverty rates throughout the nation in recent years According to the 2015 report for example California s poverty rate was over twenty percent and the state with the lowest poverty rate Minnesota was at eight percent The SPM measure contrasts with the old official poverty measure developed in the 1960s The old measure tends to apply a blanket standard for poverty nationwide but the SPM takes into account local housing costs and also extends the official poverty measure by taking account of many of the government programs designed to assist low income families and individuals Using the old measure California ranks considerably better because of course nominal incomes in California are considerably higher than in rural states and many other regions with much lower costs of living Poverty rates in places like Mississippi Louisiana and New Mexico tend to be driven by low worker productivity low education levels local corruption and unfriendly business environments But the cost of living in these areas also tends to be relatively low mitigating the effects of lower incomes The situation is different in California where relatively high wages are often negated by very high living costs And not surprisingly California often dominates lists of the least affordable housing markets in the United States The homelessness data coming out of California is also among the worst When it comes to homeless persons as a percentage of the overall population California is the fourth worst in the nation behind only New York Hawaii and Oregon 0 33 of California s population or 33 people per 10 000 is estimated to be homeless on any given night according to the Point In Time survey of homelessness And while California is not the worst in terms of the proportion of the population that is homeless the state is among the worst in delivering state services designed to lessen homelessness overall Among the top ten states with the highest percentage of homeless California has the highest number of unsheltered homeless 1 Nearly 69 percent of the homeless population in California is estimated to be on the street Massachusetts by contrast provides shelter to over 95 percent of its homeless population Unsheltered homeless are also far less likely to receive treatment for mental illness or urgent health issues Some may note of course that Calfornia s warm weather makes it easier for the homeless to be unsheltered This is no doubt a factor but if we look at Florida s homeless population we find that 43 percent of the homeless population in that state is unsheltered a difference of 25 percentage points It appears unlikely that a warm climate is the only factor The importance of housing costs to the issue of homelessness is made more clear when we note that chronic homelessness is only a fraction of the total homeless population It is sometimes suggested that the cost of housing is a not a significant factor in homelessness because most homeless persons it is claimed are mentally ill persons incapable of paying even a small rental fee The truth however is that in most cases well over two thirds of the homeless population is temporarily homeless Many of these are families many of whom have been evicted from housing due to missed rent payments lost jobs and other temporary situations These events are made far worse and longer lasting by high rents and high housing prices In California for instance only 26 percent of the homeless are chronically homeless Most homeless people are people engaged in a search for permanent housing Thanks to numerous land use environmental zoning and building code restrictions imposed on builders in California however the cost of living remains extremely high in the state The tax burden is among the highest in the nation putting many middle class earners far closer to the poverty line in case of temporary job loss Even non housing costs are well above most other states California may be the land of Silicon Valley billionaires but thanks to the state s regulatory environment the prosperity is rarely felt by people of more ordinary means Wealthy residents don t want their views obstructed and they don t want to have to look at low cost housing on their drives to work So they work to ensure that government regulations minimize new housing construction thus further driving up housing prices and rents New housing construction isn t keeping up with population growth High taxes are a burden on the middle and lower middle classes Regulations make it harder to start and sustain a business Nor surprisingly the result is a state with the highest poverty rate in the nation and the nation s fourth largest homeless population per capita Although the SPM measure of poverty clearly provides a broader measure of poverty incorporating both social programs and housing prices into calculations many leftwing columnists insist on using the older poverty rate measure while ignoring the homelessness data because the older measure makes states like California look better For example wealthy investor Ken Fisher writing in USA Today claimed last year that the poorest states have Republican legislatures and richest have Democratic ones He writes Eighteen of the 19 poorest states have legislatures where both chambers are Republican controlled New Mexico 46th richest fifth poorest is Democratic But there isn t another blue or purple state until you get to purple Maine But all five richest states have both legislative chambers controlled by Democrats Maryland New Jersey Hawaii Massachusetts and Connecticut Overall Democrats dominate the 20 richest states Fisher was using rankings published earlier by USA Today which relied heavily on the old poverty rate measure and which used nominal median incomes not adjusted to local cost of living factors If we do make that adjustment things look very different Fisher s analysis thus relies almost totally on nominal income numbers and ignores how expensive it is to live in places like New York and California For most regular people however leaving California may be the best thing one can do to increase one s real income and have a chance at a life that doesn t involve working long hours to afford a fixer upper that costs half a million dollars There is after all a reason California is exporting its poor to places like Texas
