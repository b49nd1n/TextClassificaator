 Authored by Soeren Kern via The Gatestone Institute Hungarian police recently discovered two tunnels used to smuggle migrants into Hungary from Serbia The tunnels were found at the same time that Hungarian police reported a five fold increase in the number of migrants attempting to enter Hungary Hungary is not alone Border authorities in countries across the European Union are struggling to stanch renewed flows of illegal migration More than 126 500 migrants from Africa Asia and the Middle East illegally entered the EU during 2019 according to the International Organization for Migration On November 29 Hungarian police detained 44 migrants who were found walking along a highway near Ásotthalom a village in southern Hungary Police later learned that the migrants had crossed into Hungary from Serbia by crawling through a 34 meter 112 foot hand dug tunnel The oval tunnel only 50 cm 20 inches wide and 60 cm 24 inches high had been dug as deep as six meters 20 feet underground It had gone undetected because of thick foliage in the area and because the soil that was dug out of the tunnel was dumped into a nearby canal A second tunnel was found in the village of Csikéria around 40 km from Ásotthalom That tunnel was 21 7 meters 70 feet long No migrants were found there Police said they were deploying drones to search for other possible tunnels At the height of the migration crisis in 2015 Hungary built two razor wire fences on its southern borders to stop or divert the flow of migrants making their way to Western Europe The newly discovered tunnels were built underneath those fences The number of migrants trying to enter Hungary illegally from Serbia increased significantly in late 2019 Of the 11 808 people who attempted to enter Hungary illegally during the first

enter Hungary illegally during the first eleven months of 2018 On December 1 Szilárd Németh a senior official at the Defense Ministry warned that current conditions in Hungary were ripe for a repeat of the migration crisis in 2015 and that the country is now in a state of crisis Németh said that more than 100 000 migrants are now gathered in the Western Balkans and although the situation is still under control it is beginning to look like the big crisis in 2015 He added that if the migrants are let loose on the Hungarian border there could be big trouble and we must prepare for that possibility On January 5 2020 Németh announced that the Hungarian government would double the number of soldiers patrolling the borders in light of increasing migration pressure Illegal immigration
