 Submitted by Michael Every of Rabobank I hate watching a movie unfold towards a big reveal when it is so painfully obvious that there is no way to actually feel surprised when it happens The kind of Whoa moments you got in The Empire Strikes Back The Crying Game or The Red Wedding are now few and far between due to shoddy script writing and on line spoilers for every Keyzer SÃ¶ze there are dozens and dozens of Keyzer So sos As they say life imitates art For example is anyone really surprised that the Bundesbank is now flagging a German recession this year Just look at car production data worse now than during the global financial crisis even before Brexit or US tariffs or Italy etc and it is not autobahn but auto ban that comes to mind Yet talking of shoddy scripts it is actually news that Germany is considering fiscal stimulus if it slips into recession That is the equivalent of a sick patient saying they may consider anaesthetic before major surgery Is it any wonder that German Bund yields are as negative as they are and that much of Europe is following Likewise is anyone surprised US President Trump is now arguing for a rate cut of a specific size and QE The Fed Rate over a fairly short period of time should be reduced by at least 100 basis points with perhaps some quantitative easing as well If that happened our Economy would be even better and the World Economy would be greatly and quickly enhanced good for everyone Once again Trump seems to be in tune with the markets but not the Germans You want a real surprise though USD continues to gain and is close to a 2019 high That didn t blindside us but is certainly both a Whoa and an Aaaah moment for many The US Treasury is apparently more and more interested in joining Trump in backing a weaker USD but to achieve that in a global trading system where everyone needs dollars and all the more so as risk off sentiment rises will require a plot twist far larger than Luke Skywalker throwing his lightsabre away On which note another surprise the White House has dismissed the idea of payroll tax cuts as a form of stimulus if needed Of course that would push the fiscal deficit to new levels if it happened but more importantly the prevailing economic orthodoxy is that such tax cuts are always better directed to the wealthy and or corporations which has worked out so very well for us so far And another surprise Huawei was given another 90 day reprieve by the US prompting cries that Trump is flip flopping from some and sighs of relief from others both ignoring that at the same time Commerce Secretary Ross noted We are giving them meaning US firms a little more time to wean themselves off Just look at the script s progress so far does it look like a genuine trade deal is suddenly going to leap out in the final act And another China has announced that local government borrowing is likely to increase yet again from the already pre announced CNY2 15 trillion USD305bn level of special bond issuance that has already been approved Let s recall that officially local governments are not allowed to run deficits have nonetheless run up vast debts we were told they were deleveraging they have already had one de facto PBOC bail out and they are now essentially becoming a normal arm of fiscal policy except that most won t be able to raise the revenue to ever repay this new or old borrowing given their tax raising ability is mainly via rising land prices If anything happens to property prices it s game over and yet prices are already so high they are causing social problems and distorting the rest of the economy Now where have we seen that script before Not to worry though as fiscal policy everywhere except Europe is shortly going to mean fiscal and monetary policy in an attempt to jump start the economy so nobody ever has to pay anything back we will just deflate it all away if it doesn t end up like Japan or Zimbabwe or 1930 s mercantilist all vs all trade wars Who knew that at some point the script would have someone saying I see dead independent central banks Sorry have I given away the surprise ending If you already saw that one coming too then kick back and relax with this short article suggesting that Denmark buy the US If Denmark s bid for the United States is accepted the Scandinavian nation has ambitious plans for its new acquisition We believe that by giving the U S an educational system and national health care it could be transformed from a vast land mass into a great nation the spokesperson said
