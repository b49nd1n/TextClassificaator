 In the latest insane lawsuit regarding the internet and sex trafficking a group of women who were tragic victims of sex trafficking have decided not to sue those responsible for trafficking them but online customer relationship management CRM provider Salesforce com What Huh Why You might ask Well apparently it s because everyone s favorite sex trafficking bogeyman Backpage com used Salesforce com for its CRM Yup While most of the reports on this don t show the lawsuit CNBC thankfully posted a copy though it s locked up in Scribd so we can t embed our own version unfortunately The lawsuit makes a bunch of leaps to argue that Salesforce is somehow magically responsible for people doing illegal things on Backpage The levels of separation between the criminal actions and the liability here are simply ridiculous Much of the lawsuit tries to suggest that because Salesforce is good at its job in customizing its offerings to its customers that s proof that it s magically responsible for sex trafficking In public including on Twitter Salesforce boasted about fighting human trafficking using its data tools But behind closed doors Salesforce s data tools were actually providing the backbone of Backpage s exponential growth Salesforce didn t just provide Backpage with a customer ready version of its data and marketing tools Salesforce designed and implemented a heavily customized enterprise database tailored for Backpage s operations both locally and internationally With Salesforce s guidance Backpage was able to use Salesforce s tools to market to new users that is pimps johns and traffickers on three continents Backpage could also use Salesforce s custom tools to remarket to those pimps johns and traffickers who had been underusing its trafficking services It is inconceivable that the technologies used world round to manage customer and marketing databases would be put to the immoral and illegal purposes engineered by Backpage and Salesforce It should not be our tax dollars charities and churches that carry the burden of the catastrophic harms and losses to sex trafficking survivors That responsibility should fall to companies like Salesforce that have facilitated and profited from sex trafficking Incredibly and obnoxiously the complaint uses Salesforce s own efforts to help in the fight against sex trafficking against the company It highlights some of Salesforce s promotional efforts concerning the fight against sex trafficking such as this tweet And uses that as proof of knowledge by Salesforce Salesforce knew the scourge of sex trafficking because it sought publicity for trying to stop it But at the same time this publicly traded company was in actuality among the vilest of rogue companies concerned only with their bottom line The entire assumption underlying the lawsuit is this that Backpage was only used for illegal sex trafficking and that using CRM can help you increase your sales and thus Salesforce is responsible for Backpage increasing sex trafficking That is quite the twisted logic there The lawsuit was filed in California state court rather than in federal court under California state laws so there s no direct reference to FOSTA as far as I can tell However FOSTA casts its looming shadow over this case Normally I imagine that Salesforce would make a straight CDA 230 argument here that it s not responsible for the actions of its users in this case Backpage But FOSTA potentially takes that away I say potentially because based on my reading of the final version of FOSTA which is now CDA 230 e 5 for a civil lawsuit FOSTA only exempts cases brought under federal sex trafficking law and not state laws for criminal complaints FOSTA exempts some state sex trafficking charges So as plead I m not sure if FOSTA even directly applies meaning potentially Salesforce could perhaps try to claim that it s still protected by CDA 230 and the FOSTA additions don t help the plaintiffs but who knows Now that we ve got this new untested law I guess we ll find out On the whole though what a preposterously silly lawsuit Sex trafficking is a truly horrible thing and while the complaint filed trots out a bunch of debunked and exaggerated stats about just how big a problem sex trafficking is the real focus should be on those actually responsible Going after the CRM provider of a website that traffickers may have used feels like yet another example of what we ve called a Steve Dallas lawsuit after the 1986 Bloom County strip in which lawyer Steve Dallas explains that after getting beaten up by Sean Penn for trying to take a paparazzi photo he decides not to sue any of the obvious parties but rather go after the camera manufacturer because that s who has the money click through for the full comic Federal Backpage Indictment Shows SESTA Unnecessary Contains Zero Sex Trafficking Charges Last Friday the DOJ somehow managed to seize Backpage s websites despite SESTA FOSTA still lying on the president s desk waiting for a signature The anti Section 230 law d b a an anti sex trafficking statute was declared a necessity by supporters the only thing able to pierce service provider immunity and somehow bring sex traffickers to justice by checks notes arresting or fining tech company executives DOJ Seizes And Shuts Down Backpage com Before SESTA Has Even Been Signed Last week the Massachusetts court ruled that Backpage had lost its CDA 230 immunity for at least one victim and this week a court in Florida ruled the same thing though for dubious reasons And now the DOJ has seized the entire site suggesting that the grand jury found the evidence it needed to take it down we ll reserve judgment on that evidence until the indictment is out
