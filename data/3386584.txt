 On one hand the recent surge in 10Y yields is precisely what one and certainly we would expect after all the official arrival of helicopter money in the form of 1 000 checks to most Americans means that people s expectations for government generosity repriced overnight and now the political debate shifts to how much more free cash Americans should expect and for how long with Bernie Sanders firing the first shot with a proposal to hand out 2 000 instead of 1 000 On this point Jeff Gundlach predicted during his DoubleLine call yesterday that the U S national debt likely to grow to 30 trillion in two or three years as spending explodes in response to the crisis which means about 3 4 trillion in net issuance per year and that upcoming supply tsunami is certainly sending bond prices lower potentially dealing a deathly blow to the risk parity balanced 60 40 portfolio model Yet on the other hand Treasury inflation breakevens have plunged to record lows as if the market is saying that despite this flood of new money there will be no actual inflation as much as a decade in the future To put it mildly this is bizarre and as BMO s Ian Lyngen writes this morning there are aspects of the overnight price action which resonate and others that confound Mnuchin s dire warning that the unemployment rate could spike to 20 in the absence of government intervention to address the coronacrisis had the foreseeable impact on the equity market limit down The shape of the yield curve has also performed in line with prior easing episodes with 2s 10s reaching 72 6 bp overnight and offering solace to those anticipating a cyclical resteepening But it is the outright levels of 10 and 30 year yields at 1 21 and 1 83 respectively that have led to a degree of strategist consternation according to BMO sure the inflationary impulse from the Fed s decisive policy action is difficult to ignore but then why are breakevens effectively at the lows Lyngen asks and notes that There is little doubt that this facet of the last two weeks has been the most perplexing as investors grapple with the realities of a Covid 19 world What s going on here As Lyngen notes with 10 and 30 year yields back to levels not seen since late February before the coronavirus really took hold in the US we re left with only a few conceivable explanations for the divergence with risk assets and inflation expectations To this list we will only note that Breakevens tend to correlated very closely to the price of oil which as we said last night has crashed to the lowest level in 17 years and which at least on bank expects will trade with a negative yes really price So in the event these explanations accurately encompass the underlying root of the weak performance of duration during the last week then BMO believes that there will come a point at which the selling interest is exhausted and yields stabilize All else being equal one might expect a period of comparative strength in 10s and 30s versus the front end of the curve especially in the context of continued price discovery in the equity market The lasting impact on the curve shape i e steeper resulting from the recent price action remains to be seen however the combination of ballooning Treasury issuance needs and the eventual return of inflationary ambitions bode well for the longevity of the move Meanwhile having entered a trading environment in which flows are just as relevant as the fundamentals or lack thereof the technicals will reemerge as useful tools in gauging the extent any ongoing bearishness can run In 10s the 61 8 Fibonacci retracement of 1 159 represents support particularly on a closing basis Beyond there is the 40 day moving average at 1 337 with 1 25 as an obvious interim level Momentum has extended in favor of higher rates and there is little sign of risking oversold conditions at least not yet In conclusion Lyngen believes that while it is tempting to interpret the bearish run in longer end Treasuries as a signal the worst is behind us and cooler heads are prevailing the truth is that it s still too soon to assume that the low yield marks are in for the cycle especially if the dislocation between yields and breakevens persists Rather the choppy nature of the price action is far more consistent with an investor community unwilling to take a firm stand on the direction of the market at this stage That may not happen until the Fed provides more staibility and or guidance Unless of course it is the Fed s interventions that are now destabilizing the market by sending contrarian cross asset signals if that s the case now may be a good time for traders to learn how to do something actually useful with their lives
