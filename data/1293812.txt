 It was supposed to be Risk Macr ON after Emmanuel Macron s avalanche victory in Sunday s French presidential elections instead as some banks cautioned and as we showed early in the overnight session the market reaction has been the opposite with the victory fully priced in and more and especially in the European currencies and stocks as well as S P futures we have seen a modest episode of Risk Macr Off Treasury yields are falling 1 1 5bps in flattening fashion with the 10y at 2 33 WTI crude oil has largely traded sideways and was modestly lower in early morning trade despite another monster jawboning session from the Saudi energy minister as well as Russia both signaling they could extend production cuts into 2018 indicating that what little credibility OPEC may have had is virtually gone After climbing for five of the past six days in the buildup to the election of Emmanuel Macron overnight the euro succumbed to selling the news and after climbing above the psychological 1 10 level after Macron s victory investors booked profits While the common currency rose to 1 1023 during early Asia trading further filling the gap following the U S elections in November with that move taking it more than 2 7 higher since the first round of the French elections subsequent fast money names unwound part of their longs That saw the currency fall as much as 0 6 percent to 1 0936 in the European morning Discussing the Euro move SocGen s Kit Juckes said that the Euro went up a bit down a bit and ended pretty much where it was last week It faces two short term challenges The first is that the FX market has moved a good way further in recent days than the bond market with the Treasury Yield spread not very different from where it was when EUR USSD was under 1 08 Bunds need to catch up with the currency The second hurdle is positioning CFTC data show the smallest speculative Euro short in 3 years That s still a short position of course so much more of a short term hurdle than a reason for a deep correction to lighten positions A period of choppy trading is likely for now While the Euro s reaction was perhaps predictable Macron s decisive triumph over Marine Le Pen will strengthen the EU according to Bloomberg and deal a blow to the populist wave that has roiled western democracies for the past year But the scope for a relief rally was limited after market gains in the buildup to Sunday s vote Global stocks are trading at the highest ever and U S equities also closed at a record last week after better than forecast data on American jobs The unwind in the Euro prompted concerns about broader risk assets and as a result the initial kneejerk reaction in European stocks and US equity futures has faded entirely and while Asian stocks rose European equities and S P futures fell with investors having more than fully priced the result in With the political risks that have dominated European markets in a year packed with elections seen receding the European Central Bank is expected to have more room to tighten policy as the euro zone economic recovery gathers pace Poor Chinese trade data released overnight hurt risk sentiment Following a strong start in

Additionally the FR GE spread has been relatively stable at this stage of the session with not much left on the data docket for investors to digest Top European News In currencies it has been a rather uninspiring morning in FX but one which highlighted the fact that much of the EUR buying towards the end of last week was on the anticipated French election result We may have seen 1 1000 breached but life above this level will be hard fought until we get some fresh drivers to inspire fresh longs against short term differentials From the USD perspective some will argue that moderation may take us lower than 1 0900 1 0850 some of the EU data run of late suggests ECB policy change is perhaps a little sooner than communicated by Draghi and his colleagues Germany would agree GBP has had a positive morning maintaining pressure on 1 3000 against the USD but watching EUR GBP strong interest to sell above 0 8500 now sees a fresh push for the low 0 8400 s House price data this morning was of little consequence but Super Thursday is the focus from here Commodity prices are lower across the board but this does not paint the whole picture From a risk perspective one does not have to go too deep into the impact of the Macron victory in the French elections this weekend further dampening precious metals Losses in Gold on the modest side but we are closer to USD1200 than the highs seen in mid Apr The next support we see is just under USD1210 00 Silver has already tested its respective support point at USD16 20 and holds so far Base metals still trading off China data and supply concerns with Copper now delving into the support zone at USD2 45 50 Oil prices recovered sharply off their lows seen last week but have eased off better levels despite more encouraging talk of an output cut extension The pick up in activity in the US and rising rig count temper this Looking at the US this afternoon is the April labour markets conditions index Bullard and Mester will be today s Fed speakers US Event Calendar DB s Jim Red concludes the overnight wrap Europe s ability to maintain a healthy relationship was enhanced last night by Macron s large 66 1 33 9 victory over Le Pen Turnout was around 75 which is lower than previous elections but the result was decisive Le Pen conceded defeat shortly after the exit polls were released while world leaders including UK PM May German Chancellor Merkel and US President Trump have been quick to congratulate Macron on his victory The new President elect who will be the youngest ever elected French president has also addressed his supporters outside his campaign headquarters in which he pledged to unite the rifts in France and do everything in the next five years so that they have no more reason to vote for extremes In terms of the next steps Macron will now have to name a Prime Minister with parliamentary experience who will lead the lower house election campaign and then manage the daily business of parliamentary politics Macron mentioned that his PM and government will be revealed after the inauguration that needs to happen by May 14th Our economists in France highlighted in their Focus Europe piece on Friday that recent electoral results and polls suggest that Macron s party could be the main party in the French lower house post the June elections held from the 11th to 18th An outright majority for his new party En Marche appears numerically possible If not they also suggest that a majority could be reached with the participation of moderate centre left and or centre right MPs who have already expressed their preparedness to govern with Macron in such a situation The reaction in FX markets this morning has been muted for the most part which isn t hugely surprising following the first round result and the extent to which last night s outcome was already priced in The Euro was at best up 0 23 touching an intraday high of 1 102 but it s since fallen back to 1 098 as we go to print and about 0 20 versus Friday s close In Asia equity markets with the exception of China are firmer The Nikkei is 2 25 although that reflects some catch up from last week after markets were shut in Japan on Friday with the Hang Seng 0 37 Kospi 0 674 and ASX 0 41 The Shanghai Comp is 0 92 after export growth was reported as slowing more than expected in April Gold is little changed while WTI Oil is 1 38 and extending Friday s rally with the boost this morning coming after Saudi s oil minister said OPEC production cuts will likely be extended into the second half of the year Futures are little changed It s worth noting also that today is a national holiday in France Coming back to the election theme as it stands right now the margin of victory for Macron is even greater than that suggested by the recent polls In fact this has been a bit of a recurring theme for European elections of late Indeed if you include the two French presidential elections rounds 1 and 2 then the last six elections in Europe have all seen the nationalist candidate underperform relative to what the polls suggested We ve obviously seen this with Le Pen in the two French elections while the Dutch General election back in March saw Geert Wilders Party for Freedom movement perform worse than expected taking home 13 1 of the votes compared to the polling average of 14 1 The same can also be said for the Freedom Party in Austria back in the December Presidential election as well the recent Finland Municipal Election in which the Finns Party underperformed relative to polls and Bulgaria s Parliamentary Election in which the United Patriots Party underperformed An interesting trend Meanwhile much of the other weekend news concerns other European politics Over in Germany Chancellor Merkel s CDU party was given a big boost following victory over Schulz s SPD party in the Schleswig Holstein state election had been an SPD led coalition since 2012 The result was a surprise victory for the CDU with preliminary counts estimating the party to have taken 33 of votes from 30 8 in 2012 versus 26 for the SPD from 30 4 Significantly this makes for positive momentum for the CDU going into next weekend s big North Rhine Westphalia state election the most populous state and SPD coalition run Recent polls for this state election have proven to be too close to call Elsewhere in Italy two of the last three opinion polls have shown the 5SM party to again have fallen behind the PD Democratic Party The polls covering May 2nd 4th from Ipsos Ixe and SWG show the average lead for PD of 0 9 Clearly it s extremely tight however and well within the margin of error but go back to mid March to early April and the 5SM was holding a lead or anywhere from 2 to 7 over the PD so there has been a bit of a shift Moving on Before we look at the week ahead a quick wrap up now of Friday s session For those that missed it the main focus of attention was the NFP print in the US which came in at a better than expected 211k vs 190k expected Revisions to prior months were fairly insignificant at just a cumulative 6k over the last two months Private payrolls also rose 194k in April partly due to a rebound in employment growth in the previously weather impacted leisure and hospitality sector Away from that the labour force participation rate nudged down one tenth to 62 9 while the U 3 unemployment rate was the biggest surprise after falling to 4 4 from 4 6 compared to expectations for a rise to 4 6 That is now the lowest rate since May 2007 and a tenth below the Fed s most recent year end target The broader U 6 measure also declined by three tenths to 8 6 In terms of wages average hourly earnings were up 0 3 mom in April as expected however the combination of base effects and downward revisions to earlier data saw the annual rate fall one tenth to 2 5 yoy Markets weren t hugely moved by the data Treasury yields spiked and then dropped in the moments following the report but by the end of the day were pretty much flat at 2 350 The Greenback was a shade weaker with the US Dollar index finishing 0 15 Meanwhile in equity markets the S P 500 closed 0 41 but this was more to do with the rebound that we saw across the commodity complex than anything else After we had reported WTI Oil plummeting below 44 bbl in the Asia session on Friday energy prices staged an impressive rebound into the close with WTI actually ending the day up 1 54 at 46 22 bbl an intraday high to low swing of well over 6 That rebound appeared to be technically driven rather than from any fundamental data or news Industrial metals were also better off for the most part on Friday with Copper 0 76 Zinc 0 51 and Nickel 1 39 all firmer although Iron Ore was again the exception after suffering its second consecutive 5 daily decline Prior to this in Europe we d seen equity markets finish firmer heading into Sunday s election with the Stoxx 600 0 65 and CAC 1 12 Peripheral bond yields were also 4 9bps lower which compared at a 2 4bps rise for 10y Bund yields to the highest at 0 418 since March 21st Finally there has also been a decent amount of Fedspeak to sift through On Saturday San Francisco Fed President Williams reiterated his view that 3 to 4 rates hikes this year remains appropriate while at the same time noting that the April employment report was further confirmation that Q1 GDP was an aberration St Louis Fed President Bullard said that he wouldn t oppose one more rate hike this year and that the Fed should start trimming its balance sheet maybe sometime in the second half of the year The Boston Fed s Rosengren emphasised also his desire to start shrinking the Fed s balance sheet relatively soon There was nothing particularly relevant from Fed Chair Yellen s speech Looking at the week ahead now this morning in Europe the early release comes from Germany where we ll get March factory orders data followed then by house prices data in the UK and the Sentix investor confidence reading for the Euro area in May The only data in the US this afternoon is the April labour markets conditions index Kicking off Tuesday will again be Germany where March trade and industrial
