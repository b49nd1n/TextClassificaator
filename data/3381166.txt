 Authored by MN Gordon via EconomicPrism com And just like that after a magnificent 11 year run the bull market in U S stocks is dead From its peak close of 29 551 on February 12 through yesterday s Thursday close of 21 200 the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA has dropped over 28 percent in just 30 days RIP Death may mark the end The completion of the circle of life But it also marks the beginning of something new The death of the bull market for example marks the birth of a new bear market By our estimation the DJIA must fall an additional 30 percent approximately before the bear market dies and a new bull market is born Between now and then the central planners in command at the Federal Reserve and the U S Treasury will do anything and everything to jumpstart the old bull market back to life On Thursday Fed Chair Powell grabbed Hank Paulson s bazooka and fired off a cumulative 4 trillion repo bailout But alas Powell s bazooka was loaded with blanks After a brief paring back of losses the DJIA resumed its downward trajectory closing the day down 2 353 or nearly 10 percent The stock market you see knows something that Powell doesn t know That is the damage being done to businesses in an effort to control the spread of coronavirus is destroying the economy Layoffs Shuttered doors Empty ports Quiet railroads Suspended sports and entertainment venues No Disneyland Oil price collapse No March Madness More layoffs Tom Hanks Bankruptcies Empty shelves Panic Sovereign debt crisis And soon to be empty bellies The ultimate impact in terms of GDP contraction will tailspin the economy into a depression perhaps The Great Depression II The stock market regardless of what Powell wants is pricing this reality accordingly There s no escaping it You can t run You can t hide Remember no one here gets out alive Though you aren t totally helpless You can tempt fate You can rage against the forces of destiny By this you can place bets that are at odds with the madness of crowds Of course this must be done before the inflection point before the herd runs off the cliff not after For example during periods of economic chaos physical gold and silver and arable land are proven vehicles for wealth preservation No doubt those with the means and fortitude to do so have already diversified some of their savings into these established crisis hedges Those who haven t can only blame themselves There have been ample warning signs over the last year or more that financial markets were ripe for a crisis It didn t take half a brain to clue in on this And it didn t take much in the way of resources to place a bet or two that something might could go wrong Even the lowly working stiff with a small inkling of what was coming could have taken a pass on shares of Apple and traded a small wad of paper bucks for a junk silver bag or two With a little luck these proven wealth preservation vehicles will safely traverse the valley of the shadow of death to whatever economic order emerges when the crisis abates At that point we suspect paper dollars will trade at par with fire kindling whereas silver and gold will retain their stored value Indeed gold and silver have gotten shellacked this week But as night follows day once this panic liquidation episode subsides and the implications of fiscal and monetary currency debasement are realized gold and silver will take off You can count on it In the interim escaping to a country house or a mountain cabin is an appealing option to ride out the depression assuming you have one to escape to If not the months ahead may validate the wisdom of having freeze dried food storage and a productive vegetable garden Assuming you re prepared with a little food storage and gold you can calmly hunker down and avoid large crowds Other than that the best thing to do is to try and stay out of the way as the traveling circus blows through town Hence what follows are several proven practical ideas including a 12 Point
