 With yesterday s late ramp failing to push the Dow into the green the Industrial Average is set to open lower for the 4th day it s longest stretch of losses since March as global stocks treaded water on Wednesday amid depressed volumes while Treasury yields rose around the globe and the dollar was steady as investors waited to hear whether the world s most powerful central banker would confirm or

s decision to impose higher tariffs on a slew of American goods While few expect fireworks there is the possibility that Powell will surprise to the hawkish side today after last week s stellar jobs report Still a worrying lack of inflation as measured by the BLS if not real world inflation which keeps rising is one reason investors are counting on Powell to sound suitably dovish when he testifies to Congress on Wednesday Futures still fully price in a 25 basis point cut at the Fed s July 30 31 meeting but they no longer suggest a half point move They had implied a 25 probability of an aggressive cut before an upbeat U S jobs report on Friday I think the market seems to be veering toward a less dovish message from Powell than was the prevalent a couple of weeks ago said BoNY Mellon strategist Neil Mellor who still thought the Fed would cut by 25 basis points this month the first U S cut since the financial crisis but whether it keeps going was much less clear The real interest is what happens thereafter Mellor said If we are talking about a stronger dollar then we have to bear in mind comments from President Donald Trump last week who said Well perhaps we should start manipulating the dollar Overnight Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said the central bank was debating the risks and benefits of letting the U S economy run a little hotter Meanwhile U S and

Top Asian News European indices are tentative this morning Euro Stoxx 50 U C taking a similar stance to their Asia Pac counterparts in awaiting testimony from Fed s Powell later in the session Once

somewhat softer vs G10 counterparts on balance as the clock ticks down to the first semi annual testimony from Fed Chair Powell and minutes to June s FOMC policy meeting that in theory should be relatively redundant barring any major revelations that supplement or contradict the tone of his text and Q A The DXY just dipped under 97 350 and close to technical support around 97 312 55 DMA having held below respected daily chart resistance at 97 680 yesterday In commodities WTI and Brent are firmer on the day and currently just below session highs with WTI remaining around the USD 59 00 bbl level after the complex benefitted from the larger than expected headline API draw last night at 8 129mln vs Exp 3 1mln with participants now looking to today s EIA release for confirmation of this An additional factor for this mornings upside is the ongoing weather situation in the Gulf of Mexico where the NHC are currently stating that there is a 90 chance of a cyclone forming within the next 48 hours as such multiple production platforms have begun evacuating workers and shutting production As a reference point the Gulf of Mexico accounts for around 15 of the US s total production

decisions were announced over the weekend about the firm s direction We want to reiterate that DB Research will remain at the forefront of the firm As well as FIC Macro QIS Data Science and Thematic research DB is still committed to providing extensive and top quality Company Research coverage in Europe and the US DB will combine Equity Research and Research Sales into a newly formed Company Research and Advisory Group to strengthen ongoing connectivity with institutional clients So if you are a consumer of any of our research and have any questions please let me know and we can try to answer them While a mild dose of risk aversion has returned to markets this week the reality is that it s been very quiet for newsflow with investors mostly waiting for today s main event Indeed Fed Chair Powell is due to make his semi annual monetary policy testimony before the House Financial Services Committee at 3pm BST this afternoon 10am EDT As our US economists highlighted in their preview here in the past the testimony had largely adhered to the outcomes of the latest FOMC meetings and on that we re due to receive the latest FOMC minutes after Powell s testimony Our colleagues expect Powell to reiterate the relatively upbeat assessment of the labour market but if questioned more closely about the underlying details they would not be surprised if Powell were to sound a mild note of caution about the recent downshift in hours worked As for inflation they expect Powell to reiterate the same concerns the FOMC highlighted at the last meeting namely wage growth and weaker global growth holding down inflation around the world Friday s employment report saw the market re price back towards a 25bps cut at the meeting later this month currently 27bps priced in and it does feel like it would take a very big dovish surprise from Powell today to change that from here However the Q A with Congress in particular will warrant a close watch all the same Yesterday we got comments from Philadelphia Fed President Harker which were at the margin hawkish He said that there s no immediate need to move rates in either direction at this point and noted that trimmed mean measures of inflation are at or near target Harker is near the centre of the committee so his hesitation to endorse a cut is significant Back to markets where yesterday the S P 500 0 13 squeaked out a positive gain despite trading in the red for the most of the session The DOW 0 08 retreated slightly largely due to poor performance by MMM 2 06 which has a large share in the index There was better news for tech stocks with the NASDAQ 0 54 retracing some of its recent underperformance to close higher Again though volumes were around 20 below the usual daily average In Europe the STOXX 600 0 51 also ended in the red while there was a sharper loss for the DAX 0 85 primarily as a result of a profit warning from BASF Bond markets were also quiet with 10y Treasuries 1 4bps and Bunds 1 2bps both a whisker higher in yield the latter unaffected by the ECB s Lane reiterating that substantial accommodation is still required BTPs 5 2bps were stronger after Italy s reopening of its 50 year bond As for credit HY spreads in the US were 2bps wider while in commodities oil 0 59 was a shade higher EM assets fell again with FX and equities down 0 15 and 0 30 but there were outsized moves in Mexican assets after Finance Minister Urzua resigned citing dissent on economic policy issues The peso weakened 1 15 versus the dollar and Mexico s benchmark equity index slid 1 75 Overnight Bloomberg has reported that US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin spoke on the phone with their Chinese counterparts Vice Premier Liu He and Commerce Minister Zhong Shan yesterday China s Ministry of Commerce confirmed the conversation in a brief statement this morning saying the two sides exchanged opinions on implementing the consensus reached in Osaka by Presidents Xi Jinping and Donald Trump Meanwhile the White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said that the discussions were constructive and added that officials are planning more meetings but that no details have been confirmed while saying hopefully we can pick up where we left off but I don t know that He also said that the US government would ease restrictions on Huawei by relaxing the licensing requirements and added that Xi had agreed with Trump to scale up purchases of US products including soybeans and wheat along with possibly energy as part of a good faith move to show how open China is to resolving trade differences Elsewhere Kellyanne Conway counsellor to President Trump said yesterday before the news reports started pouring in about the phone call that US officials will continue to speak with their Chinese counterparts on trade issues and perhaps make a trip there shortly This morning in Asia markets are largely trading higher with the Hang Seng 0 32 and Kospi 0 61 leading the gains while the Nikkei 0 04 and Shanghai Comp 0 02 are trading flattish in directionless trading Elsewhere futures on the S P 500 are broadly unchanged while WTI crude oil prices are up 1 31 as the American Petroleum Institute report showed a continued draw down in US crude stockpiles while tensions in the Middle East continued to rise as Iran s chief of staff for armed forces vowed yesterday to respond to Britain s seizure of the tanker highlighting the risks to shipping in a waterway that about a third of all seaborne petroleum travels through In terms of data we ve also had the latest inflation numbers out of China where June CPI printed in line with expectations at 2 7 while PPI was unchanged yoy against expectations of a 0 2 rise yoy In other overnight news Turkey s President Erdogan said that there is need for a complete revision at the country s central bank by saying that the central bank is the most important linchpin in the finance leg of economy Unless we make a complete revision there and put it on a strong foundation we may face serious troubles there He justified firing the previous central bank governor by saying that Turkey paid a heavy price for Cetinkaya s mistakes which included a failure to communicate with markets and his inability to inspire confidence while adding This became intolerable after which we made an assessment of it with our friends led by the Treasury and Finance Minister and then we came to the conclusion that making a change here would be beneficial The Turkish lira is trading broadly unchanged at 5 7339 Back to yesterday where we did get some Brexit related news The first was Labour s Corbyn confirming that the Labour Party would back a new referendum on any exit deal and also campaign to stay in the EU rather than leave on terms negotiated by the Conservatives However they still feel they can get a better Brexit deal and their position is still not clear if we were to see a general election Later on in the day parliament voted 294 293 in favour of the measure requiring the Government to give fortnightly updates on power sharing in NI to parliament this autumn That will in theory make it more challenging for the next Prime Minister to force a no deal Brexit by suspending Parliament It s difficult to say how much that changes the dynamics but it feels likeSeptember October will have the ability to see a constitutional crisis here in the UK Sterling fell to an intraday low of 1 244 yesterday which was the weakest since April 2017 and this morning is hovering at 1 2454 Over on the continent the German newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung reported that Chancellor Merkel plans to announce a new investment plan to channel billions of euros into the country s less developed regions The unconfirmed plans would be the biggest in decades and would reportedly focus on digital infrastructure public transport and job creation It remains to be seen how such a plan would be financed and given previous false dawns regarding German fiscal expansion it may be worth waiting for official confirmation Finally there was a small amount of data out yesterday In the US the June NFIB small business optimism reading declined 1 7pts to 103 3 but did still come in a little bit better than the consensus of 103 1 Later on the May JOLTS reported showed that job openings slowed slightly in May to 7 32m after expectations were for a rise That said since we know that employment data improved in June so this is fairly stale now To the day ahead now where the obvious highlight is Fed Chair Powell s testimony this afternoon Outside of that we ve also got scheduled comments from the Fed s George as we go to print right now and Bullard this evening The FOMC minutes this evening are the other highlight As for data releases May industrial production prints are due in France Italy and the UK this morning along with the May GDP reading for the latter In the US the May wholesale inventories print is the only release of note Elsewhere the BoC meeting is due this afternoon while the BoE s Tenreyro is also due to speak
