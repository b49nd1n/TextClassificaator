wanted list for allegedly committing crimes against humanity war crimes and genocide in Sudan s Darfur region ICC prosecutors issued two warrants for al Bashir s arrest in 2009 and 2010 The Russian government recognizes al Bashir as the legitimate president of the country In 2016 Moscow formally pulled out from the ICC The reason was the failure of the ICC to become a truly independent and respected body of international justice According to Moscow the judicial body is ineffective and one sided Some provisions of the Rome Statute contradict Russia s constitution including the mandatory transfer of investigated persons to the ICC the right to sue heads of state and government figures and non compliance with the principle that no one should be held accountable twice for the same crime
