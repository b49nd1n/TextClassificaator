 Authored by Jeff Thomas via InternationalMan com Here we have a most interesting collection of signage Some low level civil servant who s in charge of deciding what the motorist may do at this particular junction has become quite thorough in creating restrictions The motorist may not proceed may not turn left or right and most interestingly in the second sign from the bottom may not reverse out In essence You re stuck here and whatever you do to get out you re in violation of the rules we ve placed upon you Of course if we were to encounter this particular intersection we might say That s absurd they can t possibly hold me to this But interestingly under the traffic laws a policeman can cite us for violating the signage If we re lucky he might agree that it s absurd and give us a break but his job is to enforce it regardless of its absurdity And if he enjoys his position of authority as many in his position do he just may choose to demonstrate his power And if we defy him we re in real trouble How many laws exist in the US today The answer is that no one knows It s too complex to define There are roughly 20 000 laws regarding gun control alone and that s just the federal laws State county and city laws also exist in abundance The level of governmental dominance now exists to such a degree that literally everyone is a criminal whether they know it or not It s been estimated that the average American commits about three felonies per day in addition to many lesser crimes If for any reason the authorities wished to victimize you they d find their task quite simple Yet there s a general assumption amongst those who simply accept the laws that are heaped upon their shoulders that they were somehow necessary that legislators only pass laws if they have no other choice In my estimation this view is diametrically opposite to what is true One of my own principles regarding governance is It is the primary business of any government to grow its own power and wealth at the expense of its people This is an important principle to understand as it opens the mind to recognize that governments always move in a direction of increased control Given enough time governments will always create a state of despotism And historically no government has ever reversed its level of control and introduced greater liberty It then follows that each country is in the process of becoming increasingly tyrannical The only difference between them is the degree of tyranny that s been achieved so far Liberty and governmental control are polar opposites Yet most people have a rather vague perception of the term liberty and might even find it difficult to define This is unfortunate as it means that when liberty is lost those same people will be unlikely to recognize the fact Here are two good working definitions of liberty courtesy of the dictionary The power or scope to act as one pleases The state of being free within society from oppressive restrictions imposed by authority on one s way of life behavior or political views The first is interesting as it suggests that liberty means each person doing exactly as he pleases Doug Casey often offers a similarly simple but more refined rule of life Do as thou wilt but be prepared to accept the consequences The latter dictionary definition is probably in keeping with the perception of most Americans around 1800 but today s American would caution that Ideally that would be true but without our current laws and regulations there d be chaos Libertarians would disagree and offer only two principles that they believe would largely negate the need for laws Do all that you say that you ll do and don t initiate aggression against another person or his property And again non libertarian thinkers would shake their heads and assert that this would result in chaos Americans have become indoctrinated to believe this through slow measures As Thomas Jefferson said Even under the best forms of Government those entrusted with power have in time and by slow operations perverted it into tyranny The key to governmental domination is that we tend to tolerate the loss of liberty if it s taken away slowly In the US liberty has been in decline by my reckoning for about one hundred years but has been in rapid decline since 2001 Of course in all countries at some point the governmental domination becomes so intolerable that the people rise up Revolution follows a period of great upheaval and hardship Eventually a recovery begins and the entire process starts over It stands to reason that the best place to be is a country that has already recovered and is in the reconstruction stage a time when liberty is at its greatest The US was in this stage in the nineteenth century a period of great expansion and development However by the mid twentieth century the rot had set in America was past its peak and was ready to begin the final and most rapid period of decline At that time the Russian Ayn Rand living in the US stated We are fast approaching the stage of the ultimate inversion the stage where the government is free to do anything it pleases while the citizens may act only by permission which is the stage of the darkest periods of human history the stage of rule by brute force At the time Ms Rand made this statement she was largely dismissed After all Americans had never seen riot squads dressed in black and heavily armed barging into homes without a warrant Authorities did not yet have the legal right to confiscate all of the possessions of an individual based upon suspicion alone Yet this is exactly what Ms Rand warned against when she said the stage of total dominance is fast approaching In reflection we can have a laugh at the signage above as it was clearly created by a low level civil servant who was careless with his own puffed up authority to the point of creating an absurdity But in the larger picture the signs are equally in place Liberty in the US at this point is all but extinguished And greater restrictions are being written every day The reader is left with a choice He can either accept the signs that tell him he s not allowed to go left right forward or back and wait until his government instructs him as to what he s allowed to do or he may say That s it I m reversing out of here and finding a location where liberty is still in abundance For too long careless governments have used shortsighted strategies to prop up major world economies and prolong their time in power This can only go on for so long In this urgent special
