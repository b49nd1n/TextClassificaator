detailed earlier what a difference a week can make One week ago hopes for a last minute Brexit withdrawal deal before the Oct 31 deadline had reached a nadir after a reportedly contentious call between UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and German Chancellor Angela Merkel But a carefully orchestrated meeting with Johnson s Irish counterpart Leo Varadkar seen as the EU27 leader most sympathetic to a modified deal proposed by Johnson revived hopes for an agreement on Thursday and though some doubts reemerged over the weekend the general tone of comments made by top EU officials including chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has been positive I have just debriefed EU27 Ministers in Luxembourg unity remains strong We want an agreement that works for everybody the whole UK whole EU On

warned that although the UK s proposal is complex and the EU is still trying to suss out all of the implications of Johnson s proposed alternative to the Irish backstop the EU27 s chief Brexit negotiator is optimistic that a deal will get done this week Barnier has requested that Johnson submit a revised plan to Brussels by midnight on Tuesday Following rumors that the British government wouldn t be able to meet Barnier s midnight deadline Bloomberg reported that British negotiators have submitted a revised plan to Brussels Tuesday morning Though it s slightly past Barnier s Tuesday night deadline Johnson and his team reportedly expect to have a draft legal text ready for diplomats to scrutinize by Wednesday Fortunately for Johnson who lost a critical source of leverage the

voted in favor of no deal by end of day on Oct 19 French President Emmanuel Macron reportedly expressed reservations about approving another extension of the Brexit deadline beyond a technical extension of a few days to finish hashing out the final deal Though Macron caved last time around the notion that the EU27 might not be able to muster the unanimous support for another extension offers Johnson more leverage Even better Macron praised Johnson s new plan as a serious proposal Like last time sounds like France less keen on extending the process again compared to some other member states in theory that might be helpful to UK altho last time round Macron agreed with the others to extend again Throughout the entire Brexit ordeal most of the big sell side banks have maintained that the most likely outcome is that a deal will ultimately be reached before the UK leaves the EU or Brexit will be called off altogether On Tuesday JP Morgan s credit strategists assured

great investment advice from your governor As parliamentary support for Johnson s deal grows analysts have noted the complexity of what Johnson is proposing to replace the hated Irish Backstop Essentially Johnson s plan allows for a new backstop where Northern Ireland will exist in two customs zones the UK s and the EU s Importers in Northern Ireland will initially pay the higher EU tariff rate but if the goods ultimately end up staying in Northern Ireland and not crossing into the Republic of Ireland importers will be able to apply for a rebate Whatever happens the EU is hoping to have a deal in place so that both sides can iron out the last remaining details and stamp it with their seal of approval during an upcoming EU Council summit
