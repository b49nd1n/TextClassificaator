 Who is attacking oil tankers in the Gulf between Oman and Iran So far the answer is still a mystery The US of course accuses Iran Iran says it s the US or its local allies Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates Magnetic mines are blamed for the damage though there have been claims of torpedo use Last month four moored tankers were slightly damaged though none seriously This time the attacks were more damaging but apparently not lethal A few cynics have even suggested Israel may be behind the tanker attack in order to provoke war between Iran and the United States a key Israeli goal Or maybe it s the Saudis whose goal is similar The Gulf is an ideal venue for false flag attacks One thing appears certain President Donald and his coterie of neocon advisers have been pressing for a major conflict with Iran for months The US is literally trying to strangle Iran economically and strategically By now Israel s hard right wing dominates US Mideast policy and appears to often call the shots at the White House and Congress However this latest Iran crisis is totally contrived by the Trump administration to punish the Islamic Republic for refusing to follow American tutelage supporting the Palestinians and menacing Saudi Arabia Most important the Gulf fracas is diverting public attention from Trump s war with the lynch mob of House Democrats and personal scandals Many Americans love small wars They serve as an alternative to football Mussolini s popularity in Italy soared after he invaded primitive Ethiopia Americans cheered the invasions of Grenada Haiti and Panama However supposed cake walk Iraq was not such a popular success Memories of the fake Gulf of Tonkin clash used to drive the US into the Vietnam War are strong so too all the lies about Iraq s supposed weapons of mass destruction Curiously Trump s undeclared war against Iran has had unanticipated effects Japan which relies on Iranian oil is furious at Washington Last week Japan s very popular prime minister Shinzo Abe flew to Tehran to try to head off a US Iranian confrontation and assure his nation s oil supply the very same reason Japan attacked the US in 1941 Abe warned an accidental war may be close Canada used to have warm relations with China They are now in shambles Canada kidnapped Chinese bigwig Meng Wanzhou the crown princess of technology giant Huawei at Vancouver airport while changing planes on a US arrest warrant for allegedly trading with wait for it Iran Canada foolishly arrested Meng on a flimsy extradition warrant from the US This was an incredibly amateurish blunder by Ottawa s foreign affairs leaders If they had been smarter they would have simply told Washington that Meng had already left Canada or they could not find her Now Canada s relations with Beijing are rock bottom Canada has suffered very heavy trade punishment and the world s biggest nation is angry as a wet cat at Canada a nation whose state religion is to be liked by everyone Now Japan s energy freedom is under serious threat China mutters about executing the two Canadians it arrested for alleged espionage Meanwhile US China relations have hit their nadir as Trump s efforts to use tariffs to bully China into buying more US soya beans and to trim its non trade commerce barriers have caused a trade war The US China trade war is badly damaging the economies of both countries President Trump still does not seem to understand that tariffs are paid by American consumers not Chinese sellers Trump s nincompoop foreign policy advisers don t understand how much damage they are doing to US interests Putting gambling mogul Sheldon Adelson in charge of US foreign and trade policy is not such a good idea A good way to end this growing mess is to fire war lover and Iran hater John Bolton send Mike Pompeo back to bible school and tell Iran and Saudi Arabia to bury the hatchet now Instead the White House is talking about providing nuclear capability to Saudi Arabia one of our world s most backwards and unpleasant nations Maybe Trump will make a hell of a deal and have North Korea sell nukes to Saudis And now we wait the all time bad joke the so called Deal of the Century which Trump and his boys hope will get rich Arabs to buy off poor Palestinians in exchange for giving up lots more land to Israel It s hard to think of a bigger or more shameful betrayal by Arabs of fellow Arabs or a more stupid policy by the US But of course it s not a made in the USA policy at all Note to readers please click the share buttons above or below Forward this article to your email lists Crosspost on your blog site internet forums etc Featured image Smoke billows from a tanker said to have been attacked off the coast of Oman at un undisclosed location The crews of two oil tankers were evacuated off the coast of Iran after they were reportedly attacked in the Gulf of Oman Image Credit AFP
