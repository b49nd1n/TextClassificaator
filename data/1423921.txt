 An increasingly furious President Trump has taken to twitter this afternoon to express his outrage in a way only the President can over the thinly veiled double standard within the U S intelligence community and mainstream media over how they basically ignored the Hillary Clinton email scandal while endlessly pursuing his administration without being able to present a single shred of tangible evidence that any wrongdoing ever occurred Why is that Hillary Clintons family and Dems dealings with Russia are not looked at but my non dealings are Crooked H destroyed phones w hammer bleached emails had husband meet w AG days before she was cleared they talk about obstruction Why is that Hillary Clintons family and Dems dealings with Russia are not looked at but my non dealings are Donald J Trump realDonaldTrump June 15 2017 Crooked H destroyed phones w hammer bleached emails had husband meet w AG days before she was cleared they talk about obstruction Donald J Trump realDonaldTrump June 15 2017 Of course he seems to have a point on this one Last summer we reported fairly extensively on the Hillary email scandal while it was virtually glossed over by the mainstream media And like many people we were astonished when FBI Director Comey made the unilateral assessment that despite Hillary s extreme carelessness no reasonable prosecutor would bring charges against her Unlike the current Russia probe which has revealed precisely zero tangible evidence the FBI s own reports from last summer revealed that Hillary and her staff intentionally destroyed official State Department emails despite confirming they were aware of the existence of a federal subpoena demanding the preservation of those emails we covered it extensively here The Oh Shit Moment Hillary Wiped Her Server With BleachBit Despite Subpoena For the record Mr Comey destruction of evidence is actually a federal crime and it was actually admitted to in actual FBI testimony but only after you Mr Comey decided to pass out immunity deals to Hillary s staff like candy see FBI Is Handing Out Deals Like Candy Cheryl Mills And 2 Other Clinton Aides Get Immunity And even though Comey couldn t seem to find intent in Hillary s destruction of federal property as we pointed out last September one lone internet sleuth was able to find it for him with a couple of simple internet searches see Dear FBI This Is Intent Hillary s Oh Shit Guy Sought Reddit Advice On How To Strip VIP s Emails which does make you wonder just how hard he tried Of course until the Trump administration smartens up and calls for the appointment of a Special Counsel to look into Hillary s email scandal something that he should have done long ago given Comey s blatant mishandling of the investigation a point which Deputy AG Rosenstein obviously agreed with the Democrats have no reason to back off their endless crusade Then and only then do we suspect that Hillary might just be able to convince her party to exercise some form of reasonable judgement
