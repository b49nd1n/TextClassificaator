 It is intended to clearly ground America in its founding identity and to reset its priorities accordingly The word gospel refers to the teachings of Christ It comes from the old English word god meaning good and spel meaning news a story which was translated from the Latin word for good news evangelion The early primary Christian doctrines are listed in Griffin s Introduction and each contains good news about the nature purpose and justice of the creator Later and not central to the original gospel came the bad news appearing in secondary and tertiary doctrines some of which contradicts the essential gospel that God is love Having read this book several times I believe that it does a superb job in plain English of what it set out to do Unfortunately this central moral tenet has been increasingly violated by America s dark foreign policy under the guise of American Exceptionalism A theology for America Griffin says must deal with this darker side showing that the American Empire resembles the Roman Empire that crucified Jesus Jesus who had resisted economic injustice and foreign imperialism as demonic power opposing the Reign of Divine Values that he proclaimed Thucydides stated that if we cease to rule others we are in danger of being ruled ourselves From this fear emerged the international war system and imperialism unrestrained by any central moral authority such as a global democracy Anyone who ever doubts the unrestrained atrocities and regime changes the US has performed in at least 30 countries including Afghanistan Brazil Chile the Congo Cuba the Dominican Republic Ecuador Greece Guatemala Hawaii Indonesia Iran Iraq Japan Laos Libya Panama Puerto Rico the Philippines Syria Ukraine Vietnam and Yugoslavia should read Chapter Eleven The American Empire This scholarly research is not to be found in American school curricula Thus never ending wars promoted domestically by symbols of victory and glory have institutionalized violence and demonic power as virtuous especially in the United States A new theology is needed to extricate America from the grips of a much greater demonic power than that which governed Rome The Bible authors dealt with the politics of fallen creation in other words the politics of demonic power the same power that now drives America s humanitarian ideology expressed through foreign imperialism nuclear weapons environmental degradation and climate destruction This rampage cannot continue without the support of the people American citizens and their clergy need a sound internally consistent systematic theology upon which to ground both their own ethical behavior and the behavior they require of their governments Griffin s is the theology they need He confronts the science versus religion issue in a fascinating chapter showing that some scientists former atheists have been overwhelmed by the exceedingly precise ratios between the elements on Earth that are required for life These scientists are now saying that the universe was fine tuned for life thus implying a fine tuner or divine creator For all who have been concerned about the failure of certain traditional Christian teachings to accommodate science this gift of integrated new theological thinking has risen to meet the challenge Better yet it conveys the positive essence and divine values of Christianity As such it is a foundational guide for citizens and clergy who wish to deepen their understanding of the original gospel and to actively promote a peaceful sustainable existence Note to readers please click the share buttons above or below Forward this article to your email lists Crosspost on your blog site internet forums etc
