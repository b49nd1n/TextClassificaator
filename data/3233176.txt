 Authored by Lance Roberts via RealInvestmentAdvice com If you are a bull what is there not to love That was the message from two weeks ago and the reasoning behind increasing our equity exposure in portfolios as we head into the end of the year With the Fed cutting rates on Wednesday and companies winning the beat the estimate game as earnings season progresses the markets finally broke out to new all time highs this past week This breakout is consistent with the revival of the bulls which is needed as there is too much attention focused on a recession and bear market If a recession bear market would have occurred it would have been the first time in history everyone saw it coming Over the last 30 years when the Fed has implemented an insurance rate cut policy of 75 basis points the equity market has been lights out as the S P 500 has posted a 12 month forward return of 23 on average Raymond James H T G O brien That s the good news However before you go jumping in with both feet there are a couple of points to be made Concerning the chart above you have to decide whether the recent rate cuts by the Fed are mid cycle adjustments or cuts entering a recession While most people only notice the tall black bars given we are in the longest economic expansion in history the short blue bars may be important Again since bear markets recessions NEVER occur when everyone is expecting them the breakout to new highs is exactly what is needed to suck investors back into the market at the potential peak This is how bear markets have always begun in history On a shorter term basis whether you are bullish or bearish the market is now more than 6 above its 200 dma These more extreme price extensions tend to denote short term tops to the market and waiting for a pull back to add exposures has been prudent The other concern is the weakness in overall participation in the market Despite the markets pushing to all time highs the number of stocks trading above their respective 50 150 and 200 dma s remain in downtrends These negative divergences have preceded short to intermediate term corrections in the past As we have been noting over the last month with the Fed s more accommodative positioning we continue to maintain a long equity bias in our portfolios currently We have reduced our hedges along with some of our more defensive positioning We are also adding opportunistically to our equity allocations even as we carry a slightly higher than normal level of cash along with our fixed income positioning We also realize that all good things do come to an end While we are currently riding the bull we are simply waiting for the 8 second buzzer to prepare for our dismount That s a Texas rodeo thing if you don t know the reference Therefore make sure you have stop losses in place on all positions and be prepared to execute accordingly The worst thing investors consistently do over time is to turn a winner into a loser before they eventually sell And they always sell While you will certainly reduce your tax liability with this method it is not a strategy by which you will increase your wealth Being rich on paper and having cash in the bank are two ENTIRELY different things On Wednesday the Fed cut rates for the third time this year which was widely expected by the market What was not expected was the following statement I think we would need to see a really significant move up in inflation that s persistent before we even consider raising rates to address inflation concerns Jerome Powell 10 30 2019 The statement did not receive a lot of notoriety from the press but this was the single most important statement from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell so far In fact we cannot remember a time in the last 30 years when a Fed Chairman has so clearly articulated such a strong desire for more inflation Why do we say that Let s dissect the bolded words in the quote for further clarification really significant Powell is not only saying that they will allow a significant move up in inflation but going one better by adding the word significant persistent Unlike the prior few Fed Chairman who claimed to be vigilant towards inflation Powell is clearly telling us that he will not react to inflation that is not only well beyond a really significant leap from current levels but a rate that lasts for a period of time even consider If inflation is not only a really significant increase from current levels and stays at such levels for a while they will only consider raising rates to fight inflation We are stunned by the choice of words Powell used to describe the Fed s view on inflation We are even more shocked that the markets or media are not making more of it Maybe they are failing to focus on the three bolded sections In fact what they probably think they heard was I think we would need to see a move up in inflation before we consider raising rates to address inflation concerns Such a statement would have been more in line with traditional Fed speak We have published an article for our RIAPro subscribers Try a FREE 30 Day Trial which discusses our views on using Treasury Inflation Protected Securities TIPS a hedge against Jerome Powell and the Fed getting inflation or worse failing and fostering deflation There is an other far more insidious message in Chairman Powell s statement which should not be dismissed The Fed just acknowledged they are caught in a liquidity trap Here is the definition A liquidity trap is a situation described in Keynesian economics in which injections of cash into the private banking system by a central bank fail to lower interest rates and hence fail to stimulate economic growth A liquidity trap is caused when people hoard cash because they expect an adverse event such as deflation insufficient aggregate demand or war Signature characteristics of a liquidity trap are short term interest rates that are near zero and fluctuations in the monetary base that fail to translate into fluctuations in general price levels Let s take a moment to analyze that definition by breaking it down into its overriding assumptions The chart below shows the increase in the Federal Reserve s balance sheet since they are the buyer of bonds which in turn increases the excess reserve accounts of the major banks as compared to the 10 year Treasury rate Of course that money didn t flow into the U S economy it went into financial assets With the markets having absorbed the current levels of accommodation it is not surprising to see the markets demanding more The chart below compares the deviation between the S P 500 and the Fed s balance sheet That deviation is the highest on record While in the Fed s defense it may be clear the Fed s monetary interventions have suppressed interest rates I would argue their liquidity driven inducements have not done much to support durable economic growth Interest rates have not been falling just since the monetary interventions began it began four decades ago as the economy began a shift to consumer credit leveraged service society The chart below shows the correlation between the decline of GDP Interest Rates Savings and Inflation In reality the ongoing decline in economic activity has been the result of declining productivity stagnant wage growth demographic trends and massive surges in consumer corporate and government debt For these reasons it is difficult to attribute much of the decline in interest rates and inflation to monetary policies when the long term trend was clearly intact long before these programs began While an argument can be made that the early initial rounds of QE contributed to the bounce in economic activity there were several other more important supports during the latest economic cycle Economic growth ALWAYS surges after recessionary weakness This is due to the pent up demand that was built up during the recession and is unleashed back into the economy when confidence improves There were multiple bailouts in 2009 from cash for houses cash for clunkers to direct bailouts of the banking system and the economy etc which greatly supported the post recessionary boost Several natural disasters from the Japanese Trifecta which shut down manufacturing temporarily to massive hurricanes and wildfires provided a series of one time boosts to economic growth just as weakness was appearing A massive surge in government spending which directly feeds the economy The Fed s interventions from 2010 forward as the Fed became the only game in town seems to have had little effect other than a massive inflation in asset prices The evidence suggests the Federal Reserve has been experiencing a diminishing rate of return from their monetary policies The Federal Reserve is caught in the same liquidity trap that has been the history of Japan for the last three decades With an aging demographic which will continue to strain the financial system increasing levels of indebtedness and unproductive fiscal policy to combat the issues restraining economic growth it is unlikely monetary interventions will do anything other than simply continuing the boom bust cycles in financial assets The chart below shows the 10 year Japanese Government Bond yield as compared to their quarterly economic growth rates and the BOJ s balance sheet Low interest rates and massive QE programs have failed to spur sustainable economic activity over the last 20 years Currently 2 5 and 10 year Japanese Government Bonds all have negative real yields The reason you know the Fed is caught in a liquidity trap is because they are being forced to lower rates due to economic weakness It is the only trick they know Unfortunately such action will likely have little or no effect this time due to the current stage of the economic cycle If interest rates rise sharply it is effectively game over as borrowing costs surge deficits balloon housing falls revenues weaken and consumer demand wanes It is the worst thing that can happen to an economy that is currently remaining on life support The U S like Japan is clearly caught in an on going liquidity trap where maintaining ultra low interest rates are the key to sustaining an economic pulse The unintended consequence of such actions as we are witnessing in the U S currently is the ongoing battle with deflationary pressures The lower interest rates go the less economic return that can be generated An ultra low interest rate environment contrary to mainstream thought has a negative impact on making productive investments and risk begins to outweigh the potential return Most importantly while there are many calling for an end of the Great Bond Bull Market this is unlikely the case As shown in the chart below interest rates are relative globally Rates can t rise in one country while a majority of economies are pushing negative rates As has been the case over the last 30 years as goes Japan so goes the U S Simply pulling forward future consumption through monetary policy continues to leave an ever growing void in the future that must be filled Eventually the void will be too great to fill But hey let s just keep doing the same thing over and over again which hasn t worked for anyone as of yet and continue to hope for a different result What s the worst that could happen
