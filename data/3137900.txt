session however at 7 0326 it was once again stronger than the 7 0421 consensus expected helping push US futures higher But this time the optimism from China s tentative olive branch was short lived and it didn t take lone before a bearish tide swept across markets as first Asian stocks slumped then European shares fell and US equity futures erased all gains as turmoil in Hong Kong which canceled all departing flights for a 2nd day and total chaos in Argentina spooked investors already on edge over the trade war The weeks long protests in Hong Kong began in opposition to a bill allowing extraditions to mainland China but have quickly morphed into the biggest challenge to China s authority over the city since it took Hong Kong back from Britain in 1997 A state of panic and chaos now exists the city s embattled leader Carrie Lam said on Tuesday defying fresh calls to quit As she spoke the Hang Seng index hit a seven month low By the close it had dropped 2 1 dragging down markets across Asia and taking its losses past 6 since the protests began in June As a result global markets dropped for a third straight day on Tuesday as investors huddled in bonds gold and the Japanese yen

the local stock market value wiped out in one session after its President Mauricio Macri became the latest pro free market pro reform leader to be given a beating at the polls by a populist rival The response was brutal The peso collapsed 15 equities crumbled 48 in dollar terms and the bond market crashed with a 100 year bond that investors had recently gobbled up tumbling 20 as fears of yet another government default spiked Yes Argentina is a small economy However the last thing global markets want to see is another market friendly government fall to populism and or geopolitics said Rabobank strategist Michael Every He added the wall of worry also now includes the trade war Brexit China Hong Kong Iran Italy Kashmir North Korea South China Sea Turkey and Venezuela Did I miss anything with tired eyes With investors fleeing risk assets which Morgan Stanley now sees in a bear market one which will only get worse investors parked in traditional safe havens such as the 10 year German government bond whose yields hit a new record low even as the German economy appears to have passed right through recession and is fast approaching depression levels with the ZEW Economic Sentiment crashing from 24 5 to 44 1 shattering expectations of only a 28 5 print Across the Atlantic US Treasury yields dropped to the lowest level in almost three years gold was pinned close to six year highs and the yen was within a whisker of a seven month peak versus the dollar Quoted by Reuters ING analysts said the yen was benefiting from the best of both worlds pointing to general risk aversion and a rush to price in more interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve The dive for safety pushed gold up another 0 5 to 1 523 per ounce and its latest six year high Oil prices meanwhile held their ground as expectations that major producers will continue to reduce supplies balanced out worries about sluggish economic growth Brent inched up to 58 74 while U S West Texas Intermediate

reacted to recent flows to the currency Chinese markets also traded lower after Chinese Lending Financing data disappointed and with heavy losses in Hong Kong after its airport was shut by a mass sit in and although flights have since resumed hundreds remained cancelled as they try to deal with the back log from the disruption Furthermore increased concerns China may intervene as the People s Armed Police were reportedly gathering and heading towards the bordering city of Shenzhen has added to the pressure for the Hang Seng 2 1 which declined to its weakest since early January while losses in the Shanghai Comp 0 6 were somewhat cushioned after the PBoC set a firmer than expected reference rate and continued its liquidity injections Singapore s STI 0 9 suffered from a double whammy in

below a key tech level at 11600 which was the reversal level during the May rout with the aid of dismal German ZEW survey data and ahead of German GDP figures tomorrow Sectors are mostly lower with some resilience in defensive sectors as investors flock to safe stocks whilst the energy sector outperforms amid the oil sector s earlier gains albeit this initial upside has since been retraced In terms of individual movers Henkel 7 0 rest at the foot of the Stoxx 600 amid a profit warning whilst it also noted that it does not envisage a H2 auto market recovery Meanwhile Rolls Royce 3 2 shares continued to fall with today s downside induced by a Moody s downgrade to Baa1 from A3 Top European News In FX the Dollar remains divergent against G10 currency counterparts but firm vs EMs as sentiment continues to favour safe havens amidst ongoing unrest in Hong Kong and other parts of the globe plus the US China EU etc trade conflicts Hence the DXY is still anchored around 97 500 and the index taking cues from moves in major basket constituents like the Euro and Yen ahead of US CPI data In commodities marginal losses in the oil complex with WTI and Brent futures choppy with the former back below 55 bbl after having visited the level earlier in the session whilst the latter fell to around 58 50 bbl News flow for the complex has again been light and the benchmarks seem to be moving off of sentiment technical factors with RBC yesterday highlighting that there is limited scope for short covering rallies due to positioning i e speculators seem to have been unwinding long position rather than opening shorts Nevertheless participants will be on the lookout for geopolitical trade developments whilst Hong Kong also remains on the radar and whether China will intervene amid the rise in violent protests which is likely to hit sentiment again especially if US reacts with sanctions tariffs Looking at today s docket traders will await the weekly API crude data expected to print a draw of 2 3mln barrels ING notes that the narrowing of the WTI Brent Arb currently 3 6 bbl could point to another weak of low exports as shown by the prior week s EIA data Elsewhere gold remains on an upward trajectory amid safe haven demand with the yellow metal at a fresh 6yr high of 1526 7 oz Meanwhile copper is relatively flat on the day Elsewhere Dalian iron ore traded in a tight range whilst steel futures rose as much as 3 0 as the pollution curb on steel mills dampens iron ore demand but also disrupts steel supply GS sees a rebound in iron ore prices as 2019 is on track to post the seaborne market s first deficit in seven years and they see a deficit through 2020 Finally Indonesia s Minister noted that revisions to mineral ore export rules are currently being drafted Indonesia initially planned to ban exporting nickel ore by 2022 in an attempt to build up its manufacturing base by using its raw resources but previously noted that bringing the deadline forward from 2022 will disrupt USD 4bln ore exports US Event Calendar DB s Craig Nicol concludes the overnight wrap It may be a new week but markets have still been dealing with the all too familiar feeling of risk off over the last 24 hours In fairness there wasn t actually a great deal of newsflow for markets to get behind yesterday but poor data from China signs of further trade war escalation and additional geopolitical risks namely Hong Kong and Argentina all combined to weigh on risk assets and drive another big move lower in rates The S P 500 and NASDAQ retreated 1 22 and 1 20 respectively while the STOXX 600 fell 0 31 HY credit spreads were also 9 2bps and 0 7bps wider in the US and Europe respectively The real action was in US rates though where 10 year treasury yields rallied 9 9bps to 1 646 and to within 30bps of their all time lows from 2016 The move in the 30 year was even more extreme dropping 12 7bps to 2 133 and to within 3bps of its all time low Front end rates fell as well with 2 year treasuries down 6 3bps and fed funds futures back to pricing in 67bps of cuts through year end That understandably weighed on financials which led losses in both Europe and the US where indexes of bank shares fell 2 17 and 2 12 respectively As for the yield curve the 2y10y metric flattened another 3 6bps to a fresh cycle low of 5 8bps Our economists noted that the signal from the 2y10y is now much closer to signals from other yield curves measures which have already inverted it implies a roughly 40 chance of recession over the next 12 months The China credit data from yesterday was the main source of pessimism with new loans rising by 1 06 trillion yuan That was well below consensus estimates for a 1 28 trillion print The year on year growth rate for M2 fell to 8 1 versus expected 8 4 near its all time low of 8 0 and M1 grew only 3 1 versus expected 4 4 Credit growth is viewed as a key leading variable for the broader Chinese economy so the slowdown heightened concerns over global growth As for the trade war there was some attention paid to a comment from Global Times Editor Hu Xijin that China s People s Daily istoday expecting to publish an article vowing China can defeat any challenge and pressure the US Those factors combined are weighing on Asian markets overnight with the Nikkei 1 25 Shanghai Comp 0 74 and Kospi 0 70 all lower The Hang Seng 1 86 is leading the declines again though as protests continue and markets react to the city s airport being brought to a standstill yesterday In fact the Hang Seng has now fallen into negative territory for the year one of the few equity markets to have done so As for FX the US dollar is trading strong this morning 0 22 while the Chinese yuan is trading at 7 0634 0 10 Elsewhere futures on the S P 500 are up 0 15 while spot gold prices are trading at 1516 oz 0 34 and 10yr JGB yields are down 1bp to 0 237 Treasuries are also trading flat following the big rally yesterday Back to those political developments where the biggest price action was reserved for Argentina where the peso sold off 16 96 and to a record low of 53 0 versus the dollar following the weekend election result which saw the populist opposition candidate surprisingly beat President Macri in a landslide in the primary election In fact Argentinian assets were hit across the board The benchmark stock index sank 37 93 the biggest drop since 1990 while the country s 100y bond dropped 18 6pts to 56 3 Slightly contrasting fortunes to where Austria s 100y bond currently trades Indeed shorting the former while buying the latter would ve doubled your money this year Though of course we still have another 98 years before either bond matures for things to change The contagion from Argentina into other EM assets was fairly limited in absolute terms however EM equities and FX did still fall 1 24 and 0 38 In FX the biggest decliners outside of Argentina were currencies in Brazil 1 03 Uruguay 1 41 and Colombia 0 91 Moving on While it may have been quiet for data yesterday the good news is that it will pick up today with the July CPI report in the US this afternoon likely the highlight A reminder that the consensus expects a 0 2 mom reading for the core although you shouldn t expect anything less given that the last 45 monthly core CPI consensus prints have been for 0 2 mom You have to go back to September 2015 to find the last time it wasn t Anyway our US economists are below market at 0 13 mom essentially due to them expecting a partial unwind of June s outperformance However given that the market is already very dovishly priced for the Fed it will likely take a lot for the market to become more aggressive on pricing in cuts Just wrapping up the other market moves yesterday Italian assets recovered a bit as stories swirled that the Five Star Movement and Democratic Party are discussing a possible coalition to prevent the need for a new election per Bloomberg The Senate will reportedly pick a date for the no confidence motion in the government as soon as today having delayed the decision yesterday which could end up being the key date when we ll know whether or not to expect elections Ten year BTP yields fell 10 6bps but are still 32 6bps higher from their mid week lows last Wednesday at 1 696 In terms of other news yesterday there was some attention paid to the release of the Swiss National Bank s sight deposit data which is used as a proxy for their FX interventions Sight deposits rose to 585 5bn francs their biggest increase since early 2017 and suggesting some action by the SNB but still far less than during periods of heavy intervention Elsewhere the US Treasury released its monthly budget statement showing that the budget deficit was 119 7bn in July That takes the deficit to 866 8 over the first 10 months of this fiscal year bigger than the deficit over entire 2018 calendar year 779 0bn Looking at the day ahead now the aforementioned July CPI report in the US this afternoon is the likely data focus however prior to that we ll also get a decent slew of releases in Europe We kick off with the final July CPI revisions in Germany not long after this hits your email before the UK June and July labour market data is due to be released The August ZEW survey in Germany follows while late morning we re also due to get the July NFIB small business optimism reading in the US Away from that the NY Fed is also due to release its Q2 household debt and credit report
