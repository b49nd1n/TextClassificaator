 Support Free Thought Martinsburg WV Last month one of the most disturbing videos we ve ever reported on involving the savage beating of a handcuffed 16 year old boy was released Though the incident happened in November of 2018 authorities refused to release it until now because the officer responsible for the most egregious abuse is now headed to court after being indicted Former officer Michael Kennedy 29 of Morgantown is charged with one count of deprivation of rights under color of law He is accused of using force so excessive that it resulted in severe bodily injury of the 16 year old According to the Journal Kennedy faces up to 10 years incarceration and a fine of up to 250 000 Kennedy is scheduled to appear in court for a pretrial May 30 at 9 30 a m with a trial date set for June 4 at 9 a m According to the indictment filed in federal court Kennedy while acting under color of law physically assaulted J H a person known to the Grand Jury during his arrest and thereby willfully deprived J H of the right secured and protected by the Constitution and laws of the United States to be free from unreasonable seizures which includes the right to be free from the use of unreasonable force by one acting under color of law As a result of the defendant s actions J H suffered bodily injury Berkeley County Prosecutor Catie Wilkes Delligatti released the video in March of several police officers involved in the pursuit of an unnamed 16 year old boy whose name and face have been redacted to protect his identity According to police and the video the boy rear ended a cop and then led officers on a several minutes long chase before crashing the vehicle he was driving After the vehicle stops the officers rush to the window and rip the tiny boy from the car like a rag doll Had he needed medical assistance he was getting none Had he had an injured back officers couldn t have cared less and just the way they ripped him from the vehicle was enough to cause severe injury But it got much worse After he s ripped from the car and slammed face first into the pavement as the teen s body lay limp on the ground he is immediately placed in handcuffs Then for several moments the officers begin kicking stomping and punching his unresponsive body As if this wasn t enough after the teen was bleeding out and entirely unresponsive Kennedy is seen placing his knee on his back pressing down with his full weight before unleashing a fury of punches to the entirely restrained and unresponsive boy s face In that melee alone the officer would dole out 8 punches to the teen s face A minute later the 100 lb teen is yanked to his feet but remains entirely unresponsive and limp as he s thrown down to the side of the road After the incident the teen was hospitalized but has fortunately since recovered Because of his age details about the severity of his injuries remain sealed as well as whether or not he was actually charged with a crime Troopers Michael Kennedy and Derek Walker and two sheriff s deputies were all fired in January However one of those deputies was rehired after a hearing The brutality witnessed in this video is shocking but all too familiar said Loree Stark the American Civil Liberties Union s West Virginia chapter s legal director in a statement last month Law enforcement has a constitutional responsibility to avoid excessive force and it is crucial for videos like this to come to light so that offending parties will be held accountable Gov Jim Justice said the incident cast a dark shadow on law enforcement Indeed we agree As you watch the video below it is clear that these officers had no regard for the life of this teenage boy Yes this teen made a mistake and he deserved to be held accountable for any alleged crimes he may have committed However the officers job description does not include punishment That is up for the courts to decide which would never hand down a sentence that included being beaten nearly to death for joy riding in a car After watching the video consider the fact that officer Kennedy pleaded not guilty to the charges The crash and subsequent assault happens at the 5 minute mark in the video below Warning the video may be disturbing to some viewers
