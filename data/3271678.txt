 Hillary Clinton went on the Howard Stern show this week for a wide ranging interview with the popular radio host specifically focusing on her loss to Trump and what 2020 looks like a race she s recently dropped hints she could be prepared to enter however unlikely that might be While the Wednesday interview was widely covered in the media there s one segment largely overlooked in the mainstream but which is stunning nonetheless We ve grown used to her Trump is a Russian asset line in her typical blame game fashion anytime she makes a media appearance however she did repeat the less common conspiracy that links rival Democrat Bernie Sanders to the Kremlin Are we just going to ignore that Hillary Clinton today just implied that Bernie Sanders is also a Russian asset pic twitter com eGc5PlhB4p She wasn t even asked but briefly voluntarily inserted the reference while discussing the Mueller investigation Speaking of the Russians she claimed They were like hey let s do everything we can to elect Donald Trump Those are quotes those are words they used And they also said Bernie Sanders But you know that s for another day Stern runs with it Do we hate Bernie Sanders I don t hate anybody but agrees with Stern s assessment that he took a while to endorse her He could have He hurt me there s no doubt about it Then she delivered the final punch at a moment Sanders continues to gain in the polls especially among young voters And I hope he doesn t do it again to whoever gets the nomination Once is enough There it is her disastrous 2016 loss continues to be the fault of everyone else who are apparently all somehow Russian puppets even the Leftist Jewish Senator from Vermont and let s not forget the Green Party s Jill Stein If you can stomach watching it she elsewhere describes in detail how she felt being present for Trump s inauguration ceremony Which was one of the hardest days of my life to be honest
