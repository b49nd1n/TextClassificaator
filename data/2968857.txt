 Progressives are told to love the Pentagon budget Bloomberg 3 17 19 by a pundit whose connection to the military industrial complex isn t disclosed You may not know it but bloated Pentagon budgets are actually progressive Or so says a recent opinion piece in Bloomberg News 3 17 19 Progressives Should Learn to Love the Pentagon Budget by Hal Brands Bloomberg identifies Brands as the Henry Kissinger Distinguished Professor at Johns Hopkins University s School of Advanced International Studies and senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments Kissinger is ominous enough but surely Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments is some innocuous wonky academic institution no In a piece explicitly defending bloated military budgets however perhaps it would be useful to know what exactly the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments is We can start by reading this section taken directly from their website unabridged Below is a list of organizations

Harry Bradley FoundationUnited Kingdom Royal Air ForceBrands is a senior fellow at an organization funded almost entirely by those with a clear interest in the upcoming 750 billion defense budget Brands is pushing for While we don t have a tax filings for CSBA since Brand was hired there and thus we do not know his specific income the average senior fellow at the organization as of its last tax filing makes just under 300 000 a year They can call it whatever they wish think tank nonprofit Center but by any objective metric this organization is just a lobbying entity for the weapons industry and Western militaries A cursory glance at their policy briefs reveals they unsurprisingly always support more spending on weapons systems Unlike other weapons funded lobbying groups such as Center for Strategic and International Studies FAIR org 8 12 16 they don t even bother throwing some banks or soda companies in there to give the appearance of being anything other than a weapons industry trade group Don t be fooled by the Sasakawa Peace Foundation that s an organization founded by far right Japanese business executive Ryoichi Sasakawa who was jailed as a war crimes suspect after World War II and who once described himself as the world s richest fascist Time 8 26 74 Setting aside its disqualifying conflicts of interest Brands piece is an assortment of sophistry about how weapons systems create middle class jobs for Americans Given that any meaningful definition of progressive must take into account the 95 percent of the world who are not Americans e g those on the other end of these weapons systems and military occupations the column rests its premise on a massive category error One passage in particular displays a rather goofy notion of what progressive means emphasis added The progressive critique misses the fact that military spending already serves progressive ends Yes defense spending benefits the executives who run major defense contractors just as infrastructure spending benefits the executives of companies that build highways and airports and schools But the Pentagon budget also serves as a huge jobs program and source of economic security for the middle class This includes the roughly 2 million people who serve either on active duty or in the reserves and 730 000 civilian employees The vast majority of them qualify as middle class and enjoy precisely the sort of healthcare and other benefits progressives seek to provide for the population as a whole See if only all 330 million Americans could work in the military industry building bombs and F 35s no one would die due to preventable disease or an inability to afford chemotherapy To Brands the most progressive vision for society is the Klingon Empire a perpetual war state where service to large scale mechanized violence is the cost of survival The idea that healthcare could maybe not be tethered to exporting weapons occupation hundreds of military bases CIA dirty tricks and bombings is simply not an option Progressives only hope piggyback off US imperialism which evidently to Brands is simply a law of nature like ocean tides or entropy Brands also suggests that you can t have trade except at gunpoint Defense spending produces massive positive spillovers in the form of national security and the ability to protect access to the global commons critical to promoting U S trade and improving living standards at home And he says that what progressives should be worrying about as a long term threat to America s ability to invest in infrastructure education and other progressive priorities is not the Pentagon but runaway entitlement spending New York s Eric Levitz 3 18 19 does a good job debunking Brands argument such as it is and his piece is well worth reading But it s not totally clear how useful it is to assume good faith from someone with such deep undisclosed conflicts We learned years ago to dismiss out of hand experts funded by the tobacco industry commenting on the effects of smoking or climate scientists funded by big oil why exactly do we take at all seriously organizations like CSBA when they comment on military budgets and broader questions of US militarism while receiving the vast bulk of their funding from those with a vested interest in bloating the US military machine The reason is compared to the fossil fuel industry and tobacco the military think tank complex s mercenary experts are 100 fold more intertwined into the US bipartisan consensus It s a product of ubiquity and professional courtesy borne from having influence with both Democrats and Republicans rather than just the increasingly fringe and anti science GOP From an ontological standpoint there s little difference between experts on the take pushing cigarettes and those on the take pushing weapons it s simply a matter of scope and sophistication In addition Brands Bloomberg bio omits Brands is also a senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute which also receives sizable funds from the weapons industry While its funders are not posted on its website Rightwing Web a website that monitors the influence of right wing funding does report thatmajor supporters listed in the group s 2012 annual report include Boeing Piasecki Aircraft Historically FPRI has also benefited from the largesse of conservative foundations Between 1985 and 2005 FPRI
