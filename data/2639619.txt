 The New York Times newest editorial board member Sarah Jeong was outed as a bigot yesterday after dozens of tweets from less than four years ago were unearthed revealing extreme hatred of white people The Times in response claimed to have known about the tweets and said they were simply Jeong imitating racists Her journalism and the fact that she is a young Asian woman have made her a subject of frequent online harassment For a period of time she responded to that harassment by imitating the rhetoric of her harassers NYT Except this was quickly dispelled when several tweets of Jeong s in which she drops casual bigotry such as fuck white women out of the blue were caught by other Twitter users Now as the Daily Caller s Amber Athey reports Jeong s Twitter history also reveals hatred of cops and men The NYT claimed that Jeong was imitating the behavior of people who harassed her online but this does not explain why she was tweeting fuck the police and encouraging people to kill all men A search for cops and police on Jeong s Twitter reveals an extensive history of anti cop sentiment and a lack of sympathy for police who are injured on the job In one tweet from 2014 she wrote let me know when a cop gets killed by a rock or molotov cocktail or a stray shard of glass from a precious precious window Cops are assholes she said in 2015 If we re talking big sweeping bans on shit that kills people why don t we ever ever ever ever talk about banning the police a tweet from 2016 asserts Daily Caller New York Times Columnists New Hire Sarah Jeong tweets Called for Dead Cops I WOULD FIGHT THE COPS WITH MY GUNS Cops Could Die pic twitter com IAwKy3ZZ3w Blue Lives Matter RetiredNYCPD Jeong also fantasized about killing men joking that even if only bad men were killed it would still include all men How can you kill all the men without a good vampy lipstick sarah jeong sarahjeong jilliancyork kill more men sarah jeong sarahjeong It all makes perfect sense right Media Trump voters are white racists and Nazis and racism is why Trump won NYT Racism is fine if you re crapping on white people https t co zsK5mX99PG Doctor Jesse Kelly JesseKellyDC Of course the MSM is already starting to cover for Jeong as evidenced by journalist Tim Pool s observation that the BBC stealth edited an article to change the word racist to inflammatory without noting the update Stealth editing is beyond unethical Too many large news organizations do it The BBC by altering the article without notice makes my quoting of them seem like I m editorializing Did you know most large news organizations do this https t co 0axXdbU8bn pic twitter com 5IhGgWHCYk Tim Pool Timcast The BBC also added quotation marks to the phrase Racist Tweets to suggest they aren t actually racist Nothing to see here folks just the NYT hiring and then defending a bigot who openly hates white people men and cops Of course the Times also said of ABC s decision to cancel Roseanne The network s decision to cancel Roseanne over a racist comment will cost it But when people decide to let racism slide it costs the rest of us Unless it s one of their own
