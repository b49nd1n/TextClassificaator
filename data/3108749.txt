 Via AntoniusAquinas com One cannot speak too highly of Christophe Buffin de Chosal s The End of Democracy In a fast paced readable yet scholarly fashion Professor Buffin de Chosal demolishes the ideological justification in which modern democracy rests while he describes the disastrous effects that democratic rule has had on Western societies He explodes the myth of Democracy as a protector of individual liberty a prerequisite for economic progress and a promoter of the higher arts Once Democracy is seen in this light a far more accurate interpretation of modern history can be undertaken The book is a very suitable companion to Hans Hermann Hoppe s iconoclastic take down of democracy in Democracy The God That Failed released at the beginning of this century Buffin de Chosal has spoken of a follow up which will be eagerly awaited for The idea of rule by the people is a scam one perpetuated by those who in actuality are in control of the government Through the democratic process of voting and elections a small determined minority can impose its will despite majority opposition We often hear it said that in a democracy it is the people who rule Rule by the people is a myth which loses all substance once confronted with the real practice in democracy 13 Quoting from a Russian philosopher Buffin de Chosal continues his criticism The best definition of democracy was given by the Russian philosopher Vasily Rozanov Democracy is the system by which an organized minority governs an unorganized majority This unorganized majority is the people aggregated and individualistic incapable of reaction because disjointed 28 He expands upon Rozanov s theme C ontrary to what democracy s principles proclaim one can say that the majority almost never wins Democracy is not the system of the majority but that of the most powerful minority and it has this power not simply due to its numbers but also and above all due to its organization 31 Power does not reside in the people and certainly not in the individual In democracy the only way to express one s preference or protect one s rights is through the ballot box every so often Each voter writes Buffin de Chosal in a democracy is the depositary of a tiny particle of sovereignty in itself unusable His sole power consists in dropping a ballot into a box whereby he is immediately dispossessed of his particle of sovereignty at the profit of those who are going to represent him Ibid Popular democracy has always been condemned and feared by most thinkers since the beginning of human societies It was not until intellectuals saw democracy as a way they could attain power that they began to advocate it as a system of social order Prior to the democratic age most of the learned understood that democracy would result in mob rule and the displacement of natural authority with demagogues In short the worst would rise to the top as the author describes the characteristics of a contemporary politician The ideal politician on the other hand is pliable convincing and a liar by instinct He is not attached to any platform and has no ideological objective The single thing to which he is truly committed is power He wants its prestige and advantages and seeks above all to be personally enriched by it Any politician who presents this aspect is recognized as fit for power in a democracy It is therefore not surprising that democratically elected assemblies are almost exclusively comprised of these kinds of men and women Elected heads of state almost always fit this profile and international institutions such as the European Union consider it the only acceptable profile 35 Since the advent of modern democracy the principle benefactor of its rule has been the State and the politically connected financial elites who are in actuality the true rulers of societies Instead of putting an end to the supposedly despotic rule of the Ancien RÃ©gime which Democracy s proponents claim to have existed throughout the monarchial and aristocratic age governance by the people has instead witnessed an increase in state power and control of individual lives to an unprecedented level in human history Few if any pope emperor king prince or duke have ever possessed such suzerainty In contrast to what has been taught in classrooms on university campuses and espoused throughout the media individual rights and freedoms were far better guarded in the age prior to Democracy s ascendancy Pre revolutionary Europe had social structures which insulated individuals from State power far more effectively than under modern democracy The concept of an organic society was abolished at the time of the French Revolution The corps and orders were suppressed the privileges were abolished and everything which allowed the people to protect themselves from the power of the state was banished in the name of liberty 24 And in return for giving up the order that protected them from state depredations the people received sovereignty They were given the false promise that they would no longer need to defend themselves from the state since they themselves were the state But if a people organized into corps and orders are incapable of exercising sovereignty how much more so a people comprising a formless mass of individuals Ibid Historically all of the democratic movements which supposedly stemmed from the people were in fact a falsehood perpetuated largely by revolutionaries who sought to replace the established order with themselves While legislatures congresses and democratic bodies of all sorts have been interpreted as the fruition of the masses desire for representation the reality was quite different Democracy is not in its origin a system of the people In England with the advent of the parliamentary system just as in France during the Revolution it was not the people who were seen at work Even the Russian Revolution was not a phenomenon of the people To regard the people or what the communist elegantly call the masses as the agent of change or political upheaval is purely a theoretical view a historical myth of which one sees no trace in reality The people were the pretext the dupes and almost always the victims of the revolutions not the engines 13 Not only was propagation of the myth of popular support for democratic ideals propounded for the survival of the new social order but putting these tenets into practice was accomplished in large part by the role of the intellectual an often neglected feature of standard historical analysis and the reason behind much social transformation The nation met the desires of the philosophers who wanted to transfer power from the monarch to an enlightened philosophical and philanthropic class who moreover ought to be financially comfortable The educated bourgeoisie of the time were the protagonists of this idea and a portion of the nobility formed their audience 13 14 The intellectuals promoted Democracy because it would open up for them considerable opportunities for position and income in the nation state It must be remembered that it was the intellectuals who justified the idea of Absolutism Later the intellectuals turned on the monarchies and sided with the emerging republican classes rightly believing that democratic governance would give them greater opportunities for power in the emerging nation states While most historians see the advancement of democracy and the development of legislative bodies over the course of the last centuries as an advancement in the human condition and one that has emanated from the people s desire for greater political representation Buffin de Chosal presents a far different and more accurate interpretation Democracy he asserts is not in its origin a system of the people 13 All of the social movements which eventually led to the destruction of Christendom did not come from the people seeking a greater voice in their governance The people he argues were the pretext the dupes and almost always the victims of the revolutions not the engines Ibid Liberty Equality and Fraternity was not a popular cry but one coined and used by the enlightened classes to mobilize and justify their overthrow of the French monarchy and with it the destruction of the Church The French Revolution was built on the idea of the nation which claimed to bring together the intellectual social and financial elite of the country It was on this foundation that democracy was established and that it functioned during almost all of the nineteenth century Ibid A similar historical narrative can be seen in England The rise and eventual triumph of representative democracy in England was not one that percolated from the masses itching for more freedom The appearance of the parliamentary system in England Buffin de Chosal contends was tied to the great movement of Church property confiscation begun under Henry VIII and continuing until the coming of the Stuarts 14 After Henry gorged himself on the Church s wealth he sought to bribe as much of the nobility as possible with his ill gotten gains to insure his power An envious Parliament however wanted its cut of the loot which led to the great internecine struggle between Crown and Parliament which eventually ended in the suzerainty of the latter with the Glorious Revolution of 1688 The real power from then on rested with an oligarchical legislative branch The families who had thus helped themselves to the Church s goods morally justified by Protestant ethics formed the gentry the class of landowners who sat in Parliament Parliament was not then as one might believe today an organ of poplar representation It was an instrument in the hands of the gentry to defend its own class interests 16 17 That Parliament and the monarchy would become the two dominant ruling structures was the result of the breakdown of the feudal structure which was taking place not only in England but across Europe European monarchs continued to gain more and more power at the expense of the feudal landed elite The gentry s power and wealth was also on the wane with the rise of commercial centers which most of the time aligned themselves first with the kings and then later with Parliament The eventual triumph of Parliament however did not mean greater democracy for the people The financial incentives for England s adoption of the Protestant Reformation are therefore intimately connected with the bolstering of Parliamentary power The Parliament in England was used to put the monarchy in check and to replace it with an oligarchic class of wealthy Protestants to whom the kings were required to submit This is why the overthrow of James II in 1688 was a true revolution It was not a popular revolution or the overthrowing of a tyranny but it was the rebellion of a class implementing the transfer of sovereign power for its own profit 17 The author takes a refreshing look at the market economy that sets straight the inaccurate and often times hostile analysis of it that frequently comes from conservative circles He distinguishes and rightly points out that pure capitalism or the unhampered market is an excellent thing 123 The free market is intimately tied with private property which is a prerequisite for a just society Capitalism proceeds from respect for private property As capitalism is the reinvestment or saved money for the purpose of making new profits it presupposes respect for property rights and free enterprise It has existed in Europe since the Middle Ages and has contributed significantly to the development of Western society Ibid He insightfully notes that bad capitalism often gets lumped in with its good form while the latter gets the blame for the baneful excesses of the former Monopoly capitalism corporatism the mixed economy and crony capitalism are not the result of the market process but stem from intervention brought about by the State in favor of its business favorites through participatory democracy In a truly free market entrenched wealth is rarely maintained but is constantly subjected to challenges by competitors But what one ought to designate as bad capitalism is the concentration of wealth and power this wealth procures This danger does not stem from capitalism itself but rather from parliamentary democracy for it is democracy that enables money powers to dominate the political realm Ibid The monied interest did not exist under traditional monarchy but was a product of Democracy and the protection and extension of the bad capitalistic paradigm that came into being and was expanded by the rise of popular representative bodies Assemblies legislatures and congresses which emerged became aligned with the banking and financial interests to bring about the downfall of the monarchies The concentration of political power could only be attained after the control of money and credit were centralized in the form of central banking and the gold standard was eliminated Central banks have been an instrumental part of the democratic age funding the nation state s initiatives and enriching the politically tied financial elites at the expense of everyone else Wealth concentration is not a by product of the free market Rarely are firms able to maintain their dominance for long periods of time Many turn to the State to get protection and monopoly grants to ensure their position in the economy capitalism only becomes harmful when it grants political power to the money powers This was only made possible thanks to the advent of parliamentary democracy which was an invention of liberalism It is therefore the foundational principles of political liberalism equality before the law suppression of privileges centralization of political power censitary suffrage and the accountability of ministers to the legislative houses which have enabled the rise of a wealthy class and its power over society 124 Such sound economic analysis abounds throughout his tome The author rightly sees that because of its nature and the type of personalities that it attracts modern democracy cannot reform itself but will eventually collapse from financial stress war and or civil strife Parliamentary democracy rarely produces true statesmen as its party system more often promotes ambitious and self interested persons demagogues and even communication experts These are generally superficial and egocentric individuals with a very limited understanding of society and man These politicians do not have the makings of statesmen They are adventurers who use the state to satiate their hunger for power and money or to benefit their party 147 Efforts to reform it however should not be totally dismissed since they could lead to more fundamental change and ultimately the creation of a new political paradigm for Western governance Populism and the various movements around the globe which fall into that category should be encouraged Populism because of is lack of definite ideological underpinnings has meant different things at different times to different people Most populists however do not want to get rid of democratic forms of government but want the system to be more responsive of its constituents instead of favoring entrenched political elites Populism is a symptom of the growing failure of modern democracy s inability to deliver the goods that it promises to a now growing dependency class As a means of getting rid of totalitarian democracy populist movements and themes should always be encouraged In Europe the only political forces today which could in the more extreme of circumstances assume this rescue role are found on the side of populism Conservative in its values sometimes classically liberal when it is a matter of opposing the stifling interventionism of the state and yet ready to defend social gains populism is the only political current which comes to the defense of those interests of the population denied or ignored by the parties in power 148 He adds Populist parties from the simple fact that they can bring together voters from both the left and the right have a chance of coming to power in the near enough future The deterioration of security conditions in Europe due to mass immigration plays in their favor 148 49 While he does not explicitly discuss it a more concrete and ideological coherent idea and one of historical precedent is that of secession For all those who oppose the democratic order secession is the most justifiable logical and practical strategy for the dissolution of the nation state Secession movements therefore whether they do not outwardly condemn parliamentary democracy and only seek to establish a better run system should always be supported The most likely scenario if there is to be a change in Western democratic life will be from a world wide economic crisis and collapse of the financial system which will render the nation states unable to meet their financial obligations to their citizens All economies are hopelessly indebted from their welfare state excesses and can never hope to meet their promises which now runs in the trillions What will emerge in the aftermath of a collapse is hard to predict but some form of authoritarianism is likely which will be centered on a one world state with a single irredeemable currency While the financial demise of Western styled democracy will be evident for all to see its ideological underpinnings which have justified its existence needs to be extirpated Any hope of it being reconstituted to better serve the people needs to be shot down There is no better place to start the de mystification of Democracy than with Christophe Buffin de Chosal s magnificent
