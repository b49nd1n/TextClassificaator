 Just moments after equities closed near the highs on Friday after yet another retail driven rush into the stock market the Federal Reserve poured cold water over all the bulls when the central bank unexpectedly issued a stark warning that stock and other asset prices could suffer significant declines should the coronavirus pandemic deepen which we hope is not a shock to anyone while highlighting that commercial real estate which as we showed just yesterday just won t stop collapsing will be the hardest hit industries Nested toward the top of the overview of its semiannual Financial Stability just so nobody misses it the Fed said that asset prices have been volatile across many markets Since their lows in late March and early April risky asset prices have risen and spreads have narrowed in key markets Asset prices remain vulnerable to significant price declines should the pandemic take an unexpected course the economic fallout prove more adverse or financial system strains reemerge Why is the Fed making this warning and tying the next market crash specifically to the coming second wave of coronavirus infections which the liberal media will do everything in its power to be unleashed one way or another just as long as it crippled Trump s November re election chances Because as we said yesterday the Fed has to monetize over a trillion in debt in the next 6 weeks and it rapidly needs to boost its current paltry 6 billion in daily POMO to be able to digest the coming issuance In other words brace for impact as the pandemic takes on an unexpected course allowing the Fed to respond even more forecefully to prevent said significant price declines And just to set the scene for the coming crash the Fed also was surprisingly explicit on the other three core risks facing capital markets including And just in case someone still is confused about systemic leverage here it is again The Fed went so far as to highlight which sector the next crash may start in noting that price declines could be especially pronounced in areas where valuations have remained high and where asset values are sensitive to the pace of economic activity It then adds that CRE markets are an example as prices were high relative to fundamentals before the pandemic and disruptions in the hospitality and retail sectors have been severe The review also found that prices of commercial properties and farmland were highly elevated relative to their income streams on the eve of the pandemic suggesting that their prices could fall notably While markets settled down as the Fed flooded the financial system with liquidity this week Chairman Powell said in a Peterson Institute video conference that the economy still faces unprecedented risks if fiscal and monetary policy makers don t continue to act Additional fiscal support could be costly but worth it if it helps avoid long term economic damage and leaves us with a stronger recovery Powell said on Wednesday Of course in an attempt to stabilize the economy from against the ravages of the coronavirus crisis the Fed has effectively nationalized the bond markets cutting short term interest rates effectively to zero buying 2 7 trillion worth of Treasury and mortgage backed securities and announced plans for nine emergency lending programs five of which are up and running including a program to purchase corporate bonds It s also funneled hundreds of billions of dollars to foreign central banks via swap lines and temporary Treasury securities purchases The Fed has also eased some rules to encourage banks to increase lending to households and businesses crippled by the pandemic Forceful early interventions have been effective in resolving liquidity stresses but we will be monitoring closely for solvency stresses among highly leveraged business borrowers which could increase the longer the Covid pandemic persists Fed Governor Lael Brainard said Friday Surely Lael knows after all she is a member of the Fed and they know everything well maybe one small exception after all who can forget that just three years ago Janet Yellen said there would be no more financial crises in her lifetime To that what can we say but rigorous analysis But going back to the report we ll just conclude by saying that it was the clearest warning yet to Trump that as he rushes to reopen the economy and the second wave takes hold not even the Fed will be able to stabilize the market as it crash just a few months before the Nov 3 presidential election The full report can be found here
