 Via The Duran Submitted by InfoBrics authored by Paul Antonopoulos Research Fellow at the Center for Syncretic Studies Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 MH 17 that was shot down on July 17 2014 in the Donbass region of Eastern Ukraine killed all passengers onboard and was immediately blamed on pro Russia Donbass volunteer militias fighting against henchmen of the Maidan civil unrest the Neo Nazi Azov Battalion and the Ukrainian military The blame was assigned against the Donbass militias with no investigation occurring and many questions remaining unanswered These questions were answered by Former Lieutenant Colonel Vasily Prozorov of the Ukrainian Security Services who fled to Russia in a damning new documentary titled MH 17 In Search Of Truth The whistleblower in the 39 minute documentary completely delegitimizes the findings found by the Dutch investigators and world leaders by drawing on classified documents he attained through his own high ranking position and those close to him as well as eye witness accounts including from the Donbass volunteers The responsibility for investigating the tragedy was given to a Dutch led joint investigation team with the Dutch Safety Board who claimed that MH 17 was downed by the Donbass volunteers with a Buk surface to missile Prozorov challenges this assertion and questioned why Malaysia which owned MH 17 was pushed to the periphery of the investigation and priority was given to the Dutch side This in itself is not damning and does not disprove that the Donbass volunteers were not responsible but it does demonstrate that there is a clear agenda when a country with direct interest in this tragedy is cast aside Interestingly the Dutch investigators completely disregarded declassified Russian Ministry of Defense information that the missile used to down MH 17 was sent to the Lviv region in Western Ukraine near the Polish border during the Soviet era the opposite end of the country to Donbass Prozorov was able to even reveal the serial number of the missile 8 8 6 8 7 2 0 This revelation is complemented by the fact that the Ukrainian military 156 Anti Aircraft Regiment were operating in Donbass and had BUK vehicles in service in the region as corroborated by two interviewees who served in the regiment bringing into question why Dutch investigators ignored such critical information This comes as it has now been proven as explained in the documentary that the alleged Russian Buk movement in Ukraine was faked with a single still photo being used with a picture of a tractor a trailer and a Buk vehicle being inserted into the picture However the Ukrainian Security Service using the 156 Anti Aircraft Regiment had not acted alone and there were significant joint efforts with external states primarily Britain but also Australia The documentary reveals that Ukrainian Major General Valery Kondratyuk and Lieutenant Colonel Vasily Burba in which Prozorov knew the latter was with two British secret service agents on June 22 2014 in the battle zone some weeks before the MH 17 tragedy Prozorov claims that Burba remained with the British agents in the region and plotted together with Ukrainian Security Services to bring down MH 17 As this was spearheaded by the British intelligence there was no surprise that Englishman Elliot Higgins a former lingerie retailer who has not studied politics or journalism had his obscure blogging elevated into the Bellingcat website with monetary backing from George Soros Open Society Foundation just days before the tragedy Higgins was promoted to such an extent that he began to closely collaborate with the Atlantic Council which Edward Curtins describes as a think tank with deep ties to the U S government NATO war manufacturers and their allies and the National Endowment for Democracy another infamous U S front organization heavily involved in so called color revolution regime change operations all around the world Higgins has also spearheaded disinformation campaigns on chemical weapon allegations against the Syrian government The MH 17 tragedy also strangely involved Australia according to Prozorov with Australian intelligence agent Peter Kalver likely belonging to the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation if Prozorov s allegations are correct having a British phone number beginning with 44 and ending with 575 despite operating in Ukraine and being Australian in which the national phone code of his home country is 61 With these revelations Prozorov explains that we collected enough information and documents that allow us to draw a firm conclusion The Boeing crash was a provocation that had been planned and realized by the Ukrainian top leadership and the Western intelligence agencies Prozorov lists the main culprits in this tragedy Petr Poroshenko the President of Ukraine at the time Alexander Turchinov the Secretary of the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine Viktor Muzhenko the chief of the General Staff Valentin Nalivaychenko the Chief of the Security Service of Ukraine Vasiliy Gritsak the Chief of the Anti Terrorist Center Valeriy Kondratiuk the Chief of the Counterintelligence Department of the Security Service Vasiliy Burba the Security Service officer Lieutenant Colonel Lyshchenko the commander of the second division of 156 anti aircraft regiment The British intelligence agents who supervised this covert operation It is highly recommended that the documentary is viewed as all the information in which all of it is relevant cannot be confined into a single article The insights and information provided by Prozorov thoroughly examines and concludes that MH 17 flight downing was an aggressive action taken by Ukraine with the backing of foreign intelligence agencies particularly British to discredit the Donbass militias I would argue this was also done to legitimize a Western intervention in Ukraine Just as Bellingcat s disinformation campaign against Syria has failed Higgins and other peoples campaign to blame the Donbass volunteers for MH 17 tragedy is also crumbling apart
