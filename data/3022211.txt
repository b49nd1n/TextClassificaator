 Authored by EconomicPrism s MN Gordon annotated by Acting Man s Pater Tenebrarum Clarity Simplicity Elegance These fundamentals are all in short supply But are they in high demand As far as we can tell hardly a soul among us gives much of a rip about any of them Instead nearly everyone wants things to be more muddled more complicated and more crude with each passing day That s where the high demand is One can always meet the perils of overweening bureaucracy with pretend happiness PT For example executing and delivering work in accordance with the terms and conditions of a professional services contract these days is utterly dreadful The real work is secondary to fake work trivialities and minutia Superfluous paperwork and an encumbrance of mandatory web based tools are immense time and capital sucks While each T C may have been developed for one good reason or another over time they ve piled up into something that s an unworkable mess But like tax law or local zoning codes they must be followed with arduous rigor Crushing futility PT What s more many livelihoods depend on all the fake work that s now built into what should be a simple contract Auditors contract administrators accountants MBAs spreadsheet jockeys risk managers and many other fake professionals run about with rank importance What would happen to these plate spinners if the fake work disappeared Without all the unnecessary rigmarole the unemployment rate would quadruple overnight Hence like fake money fake work is piled on by the boatload to stimulate the need for more fake work And like a handshake agreement or sound money the return to an era of greater clarity simplicity and elegance is mere wishful thinking So too clarity simplicity and elegance have disappeared from monetary policy Today s fake money requires a crude network of central planners and a crude system of price fixing The underlying theory of it all is that a committee of central planners can improve the future by jerking the chain of credit markets Integral to this process is something called the dot plot If you happen to be ignorant of the dot plot we must apologize What follows will forever end your bliss The dot plot a central planner guessing game that suffers from a lack of crystal balls at the Fed PT The dot plot is a chart that includes each Federal Reserve Governor s anonymous forecast for the federal funds rate The dots represent the best guesses of each central bank governor as to the appropriate federal funds rate at the end of each calendar year Annual dots are provided extending out three years into the future as well as a dot for the longer run Varying models are used by the central planners to ascertain the appropriate location to plot their dots Many of these models are calibrated using fake aggregate economic data Garbage goes in Garbage comes out Dots are placed accordingly The whole exercise is absolutely ludicrous if you re in the mood for a practical joke Yet this is the muddled and crude world of monetary policy that is distorting the economy and financial markets in strange and unnatural ways Several months ago while speaking at the Stanford University economics summit Fed Chair Jerome Powell offered the following insight If you are too focused on a few dots you may miss the larger picture Clearly Powell has missed the larger picture Why Fed Chair Powell is a Laughingstock Just this week for example Powell zoomed in on the dots and concluded that the federal funds rate should remain within a range or 2 25 to 2 5 percent At the same time via an implementation note Powell lowered the interest on excess reserves IOER rate 5 basis points to 2 35 percent Funny enough the effective federal funds rate is beginning to move higher lately but now IOR is below the FF rate for the first time and in theory that should spur inflationary lending activity We are not so sure this plan is going to work Note IOR was introduced as a tool to keep the FF rate under control despite QE which has made short shrift of the traditional method of doing so PT Powell believes this technical adjustment will compel banks with excess reserves parked at the Fed to pursue better returns elsewhere Powell also believes lowering the IOER rate will keep the federal funds rate from deviating above its upper range At the Fed s press conference on Wednesday Powell provided the following clarification We do think it s important that we are able to control the federal funds rate and generally keep it within the range That s just good monetary policy monetary control So we think it s important and we have the tools to do that so we ve used them again today and again this is just a technical fix It really has no implications for policy Or does it Based on the government s data reports The unemployment rate is currently at 3 8 percent Real GDP increased 3 2 percent in the first quarter of 2019 The S P 500 and the Nasdaq recently hit all time highs Given these agreeable numbers shouldn t the Fed be normalizing monetary policy Why bother with this ridiculous technical adjustment Perhaps the economy is not as strong as the headline data says it is What happened with taking away the punch bowl PT But more important than the future direction of the federal funds rate is the question of why there is even a federal funds rate to begin with The work is crude The work is fake The plotted dots are meaningless And Fed Chair Powell is a laughingstock
