 A fine RT interview with Moussa Ibrahim Gaddafi s ex spokesperson While pointing out the role of NATO and mainstream media in Libya s destruction Ibrahim accepts and explains the blind spots failures in Gaddafi s rule Three things he mentions that they failed to shift away diversify from the oil export economic model that they didn t seek an alliance with Russia and China that their political process wasn t inclusive enough Ibrahim also talks about the good things Gaddafi s rule achieved in the larger context of African struggle for liberation and economic independence Gaddafi was hoping to accumulate 4 thousand tons of gold as reserves for his pan national project of an African Central Bank alongside the creation of an African currency I have to say that while the goal is noble and strategic the way of going about it wasn t inspired Sure gold is a commodity which can be used as a hedge against inflation but in order to build up stock of it which incurs physical costs of transport and storage they had to net export oil in order to purchase foreign currency with which to buy the gold It would have been a lot simpler and less costly in real terms to have this African Central Bank issue a free floating fiat currency controlled by a democratic board composed of African member states Give permanent extrinsic value to this currency through taxation preferably a land value tax and issuing it to employ labor land and capital machinery and equipment for productive purposes which benefit the African nations You don t need physical commodity reserves in order to facilitate settlement payments provide overdrafts buy Government and or private sector assets or liabilities or provide loans for long term investment The classical gold standard era 1880 1914 is a myth Credit mostly unbacked by metal was the predominant form of money throughout that entire period To illustrate the power of fiat these two examples should suffice The Allies USSR included won WW2 using fiat money Had they stuck to the gold standard during that time i e allowing the currency to be redeemed in metal they would have gone bankrupt and lost the conflict Nazi Germany became an economic and military superpower without gold At present it s estimated that 16 percent of the world s gold and 22 percent of its silver is currently sitting inside tech all over Japan That s a productive role for these commodities instead of using them as a speculative tool And just like commodities IOUs credit debt money contracts can be used for productive or speculative purposes Don t torch the paper along with the ink and quill just remove the bad clauses in the contract another way of saying don t throw the baby out with the dirty bath water Hitler said We were not foolish enough to make a currency backed by gold of which we had none but for every mark that was issued we required the equivalent of a mark s worth of work done or goods produced we laugh at the time our national financiers held the view that the value of a currency is regulated by the gold and securities lying in the vaults of a state bank In 1833 economist Friedrich List argued the same principle People will probably ask me where will Bavaria get the money to complete such giant works railways I answer that I have not yet seen any silver or gold in any of the canals or railways To build them we use only consumer goods steel stones wood manpower the power of animals But is there not a surplus of all this in Bavaria To the extent that we transform this surplus into canals and railways which are not yet in existence we create permanent and enduring value we create an instrument which doubles the productive power of the entire nation The money however does not leave the country it only settles accounts What the detractors of fiat money don t understand is the distinction between IOUs and commodities between IOUs recorded in expensive medium gold silver etc and inexpensive medium paper plastic electronic entries Fiat money has no intrinsic value but it does have extrinsic value The trap developing nations fall into is accruing reserves in foreign currencies numbers which they own but that exist on the electronic spreadsheets of foreign central banks This is alright so long as those countries you re exporting to remain friendly If they re geopolitically aligned against you however they can freeze those accounts you own undoing all the work you put into exporting goods and resources in exchange for their money And now you re left with no foreign funds necessary to pay for imports Anyway it s clear that Gaddafi s plan for an independent pan African currency and payments system threatened violated the Unipolar establishment NATO can t allow sovereign nations to be truly sovereign and escape US dollar hegemony They d rather go to war over it fund death squads assassinations levy sanctions the works A fine RT interview with Moussa Ibrahim Gaddafi s ex
