 Morning Consult reported on July 18th that the 11 U S state governors who have the highest approval ratings in their state are 1 Charlie Baker MA 71 2 Larry Hogan MD 68 3 Matt Mead WY 67 4 Doug Burgum ND 66 5 Dennis Daugaard SD 65 6 Kay Ivey AL 64 7 Brian Sandoval NV 62 8 Phil Scott VT 62 9 Gary Herbert UT 61 10 11 TIE Bill Haslam TN Asa Hutchinson AR both 60 approval and both have 23 disapproval so they re tied All 11 are Republican The 10 with the lowest approval ratings include 7 Republicans Chris Christie Sam Brownback Mary Fallin Rick Snyder Scott Walker Bruce Rauner and Paul LePage Two others are Democrats Dan Malloy Gina Raimando One is independent Bill Walker Here they re ranked starting with the worst the highest disapproval rating 1 Chris Christie NJ 69 2 Sam Brownback KS 66 3 Dan Malloy CT 64 4 Mary Fallin 55 OK 5 Rick Snyder MI 52 6 Scott Walker WI 51 7 Bruce Rauner IL 49 8 Paul LePage ME 48 47 approve 9 Bill Walker AK 48 42 approve 10 Gina Raimando RI 47 Republicans include all 10 of the best and 7 of the worst Democrats include none of the best and two of the worst Wikipedia says There are currently 33 Republicans 16 Democrats and one independent serving as state governors On that basis one would expect two thirds of the worst list to be Republicans and 7 actually are which of course fits that statistical two thirds expectation Also on the same basis one would expect one third of the best list to be Democrats but none actually are which of course is extremely bad performance for Democrats The list of eleven best may be expected to include some future Republican Presidential contenders but that wouldn t be until 2024 at the earliest or if Mike Pence becomes installed soon so a lot can change between then and now and this list strong as it is for the Republican Party has no substantial relevance to Presidential politics unless Pence becomes installed However the lack of Democrats on the ten best list does suggest that the next Democratic nominee for the U S Presidency will come from among the 46 Democratic U S Senators since their governors aren t performing well The ten Senators with the highest approval ratings within their respective state are not necessarily Presidential contenders because a very popular Senator in a liberal state such as Vermont might not perform well in a U S national election and the same is true of a very popular Senator in a conservative state Each Senator s Presidential potential has to be considered based not only upon his her approval rating but upon his her state s normalcy or representativeness of the total U S electorate One state stands out as being the most representative of them all and it is Ohio As Ohio goes so goes the nation is the general rule Ohio has one Democratic U S Senator Sherrod Brown His approval rating which might therefore be considered reasonably likely to reflect what his approval rating nationally would be if he were the U S President is 52 approve 30 disapprove This is bettered slightly by his state s Republican U S Senator Robert Portman s 53 to 27 rating and both Brown and Portman have extensive records representing their state nationally both are well known to the voters so in both cases these are meaningful numbers If Trump were to be impeached and replaced by Pence then Portman just like some Republican Senators would be a Presidential contender but otherwise not A remarkable thing about Sherrod Brown is the extent to which he is far more progressive than the people whom he represents whereas Portman is ideologically well representative of Ohioans Brown is not he is far more progressive and yet he has almost as high approval rating from Ohioans as does Portman who ideologically is far closer to Ohioans Sherrod Brown is definitely a leader and not a follower but even people who disagree with him are approving of him following his leadership voting for him Quite possibly then he is the likeliest person to win the Democratic Party s Presidential nomination in 2020 if Democrats want a winner However the U S Senator with the highest of all approval ratings 75 to 21 is Bernie Sanders the progressive Democratic Senator from the very progressive state of Vermont and he has already demonstrated extensively his ability to win votes also nationwide even from some people who disagree with him on some important issues He is golden but he is also very gray nearly 76 years old and so his likeliest participation in the 2020 Presidential contest will be as the most influential of all potential endorsers of other candidates Whom then might he endorse in the primaries Here again his Senate colleague Sherrod Brown stands out He s 65 years old and so he d be 69 entering the White House in 2021 and this fits within established norms Sherrod Brown is golden for progressives except for one major thing he s a leader of the pro military NATO alliance anti Russia and anti Iran movement in the Democratic Party and even in the entire U S Senate He would as President probably be golden for Lockheed Martin Right now his second biggest source of campaign funds comes from JStreetPAC The Political Home for Pro Israel meaning pro Saud anti Iran and thirdly anti Russia U S foreign policies This is also huge for building and selling more U S weapons including more missiles in order to command Russia s compliance and bring them into the Saudi Israeli fold to separate Russia from its alliance with Iran The Sauds have tried to do this before but failed Brown s top funders have been employees from the Ohio State University system but the highly concentrated JStreetPAC basically owns him right now at least as regards foreign policies Bernie Sanders has a much less narrow contributor base His Top Contributors federal election data for Bernie Sanders 2016 cycle is very diverse but slightly dominated by Silicon Valley high tech and that s not obsessively pro military industrial complex or MIC which virtually owned his opponent Hillary Clinton far more than it owns Sherrod Brown via the Sauds and Israelis But the MIC tried mightily to buy Sanders too the difference being that he never received much money from the Saudi Israeli lobby or donors Furthermore Sanders s Top 20 Contributors to Campaign Cmte were mainly labor unions which nowadays since industrial labor unions are virtually dead are mainly government workers Moreover Sanders s voting record has not been very favorable toward the Sauds or the Israelis and he has strongly criticized the MIC He might object to Brown s sell outs to the MIC He might go against Brown Is there anyone outside the U S Senate or governorships who might also contend for the Democratic nomination Only one person a U S Representative member of the House one of the two who represent Hawaii Tulsi Gabbard She s the person who delivered the nominating speech for Sanders against Clinton at the 2016 Democratic National Convention On 31 January 2017 I wrote about her being The U S Politician Who Could Become Second Abraham Lincoln because one of her similarities to Lincoln is that though she s only a member of the U S House lots of extremely well informed progressives are already talking about her as being a serious contender for her Party s Presidential nomination in 2020 and I explained there why Moreover which I didn t address there a possibility exists that Gabbard might contend in 2018 in a Democratic primary against current U S Senator Mazie Hirono who like Hawaii s other U S Senator Brian Schatz was one of the earliest people to endorse Hillary Clinton for President and who stood by Clinton after Sanders entered the race Both of Hawaii s U S Senators also voted for S 722 a bill to introduce steps toward war against both Iran and Russia Sanders voted against it If it gets to the House then Gabbard would almost certainly be one of the few Representatives who would vote Nay on it Both of Hawaii s two Senators are numbers 2 and 3 among all 100 in terms of popularity among the people of their state However Bernie Sanders had beat Hillary Clinton in the Hawaii Democratic Caucuses in 2016 by 71 5 to only 28 3 for Clinton The 59 year old Senator Hirono is being treated for a recently discovered stage four cancer of the kidney which was removed but was found to be a metastacized cancer but Hirono still insists that she will be running in 2018 for re election to another six year term in the U S Senate If the 36 year old Rep Gabbard decides to contest Hirono s Senate seat Gabbard might win If that were to happen then the young Gabbard would enter the U S Senate in 2019 on a rocket ship heading toward the White House just like Obama rocketed into the White House after having served in the U S Senate only during the brief period of January 3 2005 to November 16 2008 and unlike Gabbard no time at all in the U S House nor outside of local politics Other than these stated similarities and the fact that both Obama and Gabbard are cool in temperament and are from Hawaii they are very different politicians with very different backgrounds and policies almost like they re from different political parties or maybe different worlds But even if Gabbard runs against the popular Hirono and loses Gabbard will still be a significant factor in the 2020 Democratic Presidential primaries especially if Sanders endorses her as she had endorsed him early in his contest when he was given little chance of winning Investigative historian Eric Zuesse is the author most recently of They re
