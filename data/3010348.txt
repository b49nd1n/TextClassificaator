 Just hours after Nancy Pelosi attempted to mend the gaping division between the realists and the extremists in her party failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton decided to pile into the impeachment debate with her own take on the Mueller Report Well I think what Nancy means and I agree with what she means is that it shouldn t be a preordained conclusion it shouldn t be what you do for partisan political purposes almost outside the framework of the Constitution she said during an appearance at the Time 100 Summit in New York You don t put impeachment on the table as the only item on the table and say you re going to get there no matter what which is what happened in 99 Instead you say we are going to proceed with the seriousness that this demands Dripping with irony Clinton whose husband was impeached by the House of Representatives in 1998 for perjury and obstruction of justice only to be acquitted the following year by the Senate and allegedly used her position to gain personal wealth through pay to play peddling of her and her husband s influence discuss the roadmap to President Trump s impeachment and said he should have been indicted I have a kind of weird personal history about impeachment Clinton said to laughter from the audience But not what you re thinking she added referring to her time as a staff attorney serving on the impeachment inquiry for former President Richard Nixon two decades earlier in 1974 I was one of the young lawyers who actually drafted the memo about what is a high crime and misdemeanor and it was truly meant by our founders to describe actions that undermine the integrity of our government that placed the personal or political interest in a president over the interest of the nation she said Which apparently gives her prime position to contradict Special Counsel Mueller and Attorney General Barr s findings once again relating everything back to the Russians that stole her election presumably Actions that undermine the integrity of our government That placed the personal or political interests of a president over the interests of the nation And in so doing we were able to make a case that was accepted by the Judiciary Committee that then voted out articles of impeachment on a bipartisan basis So I know what it looks like and I know what is required to do it in a way that wins the trust and confidence not only of the Congress but of the American people But I certainly think that the roadmap as some call it of the Mueller report raises so many serious questions in part one about what the Russians did which is beyond debate and in part two about all of the evidence about obstruction Hillary Clinton addressing Mueller report Time100 conference pic twitter com bkF7AuMPyC She went on to detail the roadmap to Trump s impeachment I m really of the mind that the Mueller report is part of the beginning because there s still so much more that we should know and that we should act upon And we re a long way from knowing because we need to get the full report the unredacted version Hillary Clinton I m really of the mind that the Mueller report is part of the beginning because there s still so much more that we should know and that we should act upon And we re a long way from knowing because we need to get the full report the unredacted version pic twitter com ajlw0pYeFd Leaving the best for last as if somehow amid all the Deep State hatred and conspiracy Trump escaped real justice I think there is enough there that any other person who had engaged in those acts would certainly have been indicted I think there is enough there that any other person who had engaged in those acts would certainly have been indicted HillaryClinton on whether Donald Trump obstructed justice or not at the TIME100 Summit https t co LesjLJH44j pic twitter com rRg2MnEmA9 How long before Clinton launches the LockHimUp Perhaps LetItGo is more appropriate
