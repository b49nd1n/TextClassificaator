September 11 2001 becoming the first legislative body in the country to do so Transcript Andrew Steele On July 24 2019 the Franklin Square and Munson Fire District which oversees a volunteer fire department that serves a hamlet of 30 000 residents just outside of Queens New York made history by unanimously passing a resolution that supports a new investigation into the events of September 11 2001 becoming the first legislative body in the country to do so Today we re joined by the man who introduced that resolution Christopher Gioia He s a former firefighter and chief of the Franklin Square and Munson Fire Department and now a commissioner that oversees that department Mr Gioia welcome to the show Christopher Gioia Thank you very much Mr Steele Steele Before we get into the big news that everybody is talking about in the movement and all throughout alternative media we want to get to know you a little bit more so please tell us about yourself and your career Gioia Well let s see I am presently in the construction industry Franklin Square Fire Department is a volunteer fire department We re comprised of people from all walks and all trades I ve been in Franklin Square I guess for most of my life I grew up maybe a block away from the firehouse so when I was growing up I used to sit on the curb and watch the firetrucks go by I always wanted to be a fireman In the meantime I completed high school and I had joined the Marine Corps When I had gotten out of the Marine Corps I came back to town and I wanted to continue my service because the fire department is a paramilitary organization so I went to the fire department and I joined the local fire department I ve been with the Franklin Square Munson Fire Department now for 32 years I rose through the ranks lieutenant and captain I went through the chief s office We have three chiefs second assistant first assistant and then you become chief of department Those are two year terms Then some years went by We also have the fire district which is comprised of five fire commissioners who are responsible for the buildings and the grounds the maintenance of the equipment uniforms and such Pretty much it s administrative and you pay the bills but it is an elected position and you have to submit a petition and run for office and there are other people out there that you have to run against so you actually have to mount a campaign Then whatever monies because it s public money everything has to be done according to state law Everything has to be voted on and there s policies and procedures and everything has to be on the up and up and above board We are audited by the state We have our own internal auditors Every penny is accounted for and we do run a tight ship over here I ve been a commissioner now for about I guess three years They re five year terms so I m probably about halfway through You lose track of time When you get older things have a tendency to blur a little bit Steele Is it just one term that you have or are allowed or are you allowed to run again when the five years are up Gioia You can run again for another five year term You could actually stay in office The other four commissioners have been in office 10 15 maybe 20 years so I m pretty much the new kid on the block The other members We have another ex chief who s sitting on the board as well He was chief of the department back in the late 80s or the early 90s That would actually be Commissioner Malloy Then you have Commissioner Saltzman who is a member of Engine Company Number Three You have Commissioner Lyons who is a member of Engine Company Number Two Commissioner Joseph Torregrossa he s the chairman and he s also a member of Engine Company Number Two You can run again Five year terms is a long time but if you re in there and you like what you re doing it s pretty procedural after For me personally after being chief and being commissioner coming into the district it s actually a less hectic pace When you re chief you respond to every call and you re out there on the front lines Pretty much the commissioners are the ones in the background just paying all the bills It s a lot less hectic It s more relaxed When you get a little older you want to be a little bit more relaxed Steele I understand that myself as I m getting older Believe me Now please tell us about your 9 11 story Where were you on the day of September 11th and how did you first hear the news Gioia On 9 11 I was working As I said I do construction for a living I m a construction surveyor I work for a large construction company I was working on new construction of a small power plant on the river the East River in Brooklyn just north of the Williamsburg Bridge I was working with a gentleman who works in Upstate New York We were working We re less than two miles from the Trade Center and you have a spectacular view of Manhattan from the Brooklyn side of the river We heard this explosion me and my partner and he remarked something like Is somebody blasting around here Because he knew what the sound was It didn t register so we looked around and somebody said Hey look The Trade Center the Twin Towers is on fire We were looking at it and we re like We pretty much knew right away We re like okay a plane hit it or a helicopter hit it It was up high and there was enough smoke and fire that we could see Then somebody ran out of one of the trailers and said that a plane had hit the North Tower It was a spectacularly beautiful day It was just this beautiful blue sky There wasn t a cloud in the sky and it was this perfect day I m thinking to myself I m like this guy whoever was flying the plane how could you hit the building It s just absolutely perfect flying weather I have survey equipment which is pretty much like a telescope so we focused the instruments on the North Tower and I could see the imprint of the plane I could actually see everything Just looking at it it was registering that we all thought it was maybe a small propeller plane like a Piper Cub or something like that but just from looking at the damage it was like you knew that it was something larger In the meantime then the person People were running around scurrying and they didn t know what was going on and then all of a sudden we were watching Then from our vantage point we couldn t see the plane coming from the other side because the second plane that hit the South Tower came from the Statue of Liberty side which is the New Jersey side and the building exploded and it blew out on the side and then all hell broke loose We were like we re under attack you know People just wanted to leave the job Me and my partner we were transfixed on what we were seeing because we had the instruments set up and people wanted to see what was going on We actually could see people waving for help I could see people waving their clothes from the windows I actually saw the lady who was perched at the bottom of the impact hole in the North Tower I believe she was identified and she ultimately wound up being killed but I saw her Then it got even worse because then you saw people jumping out of the building and then that was it I couldn t watch it anymore and I had to get home to my wife and my kids My son was just about a year old I told my boss I said Listen I m out of here so I jumped in my truck and we re about From Brooklyn to my house is probably about 20 miles and it s about maybe five or six miles to get to the Brooklyn Queens Expressway When I had driven about five miles to get on the expressway when I got up to the expressway I looked in the rear view mirror and the whole sky of Manhattan down by the Trade Centers was just blacked out by this cloud I guess the North Tower had collapsed but I didn t know it yet People had just stopped on the highway and everybody was just staring I turned on the radio and then all kinds of reports were coming in I just I flew home and I made it home in record time It must ve taken me 15 20 minutes because I was literally doing 90 miles an hour down the highway to get home I got home and I threw open the door My wife looked at me and she goes the South Tower just collapsed I couldn t understand I said to her I go What do you mean the South Tower just collapsed I go What happened to the North Tower She said That one collapsed 15 minutes ago I just sat back down on the couch with my wife and we just sat there and we watched TV We were just in shock because it was just too much to take in We just sat there and we just watched watched the TV and we just watched everything as it unfolded Steele It was horrible enough to watch it on television from Florida where I was at the time I can t imagine standing there watching what you just described through your equipment that day and seeing that I know for New Yorkers it had of course a more profound impact because they actually lived it people in New York and in the surrounding areas It happened right in front of them I understand that you had friends that died on September 11th Do you want to tell us about them and the lives that they lived Gioia Yes that s correct Andrew I lost three of my friends who were city firemen One of them Thomas Hetzel was in the department here in Franklin Square The other two lived in Franklin Square and I was friends with them I grew up with firefighter Robert Evans We used to pretty much hang out maybe down at the park He was a friend from school Then the other firefighter Michael Kiefer he was one of these kids who used to come around the firehouse on his bicycle and he was a We d call him a buff He would have his scanner and he would follow the trucks around He grew up and he joined the fire department He went into the towers He responded They never found him I think they found little bits and pieces of Bobby I was speaking to his sister the other day They actually recovered some more parts or bone fragments Tom they found in a stairwell He was on his way out of the building I was really good friends with Tom I pretty much grew up with him I went to his wedding We did things together and he was a good friend They were all good people Steele September 11th happened You obviously have a personal connection to the event through your friends that died through the fire department How did you come to be exposed to the World Trade Center evidence that AE911Truth puts forth Gioia After 9 11 the town really pulled together the town of Franklin Square We opened up the firehouse and people were asked to drop off donations whatever they could donate in the way of maybe food water clothing whatever supplies that they could think of that we packed onto a truck and we actually brought down to Ground Zero to give out to the rescue workers One of my friends in the fire department is a retired airline pilot He was an FAA instructor He flew every kind of aircraft and he was totally familiar with jet planes and everything like that One of the stories that struck us odd right from the get go and he even said this was that they mentioned that the hijackers had turned off the system on the plane and that stopped the air traffic controllers from seeing them He was like Well if they turn that off that doesn t erase the radar signature That always struck me as odd and even struck him as odd because they were saying well they couldn t track the plane but that s not true That always stuck in my brain and then years went by and didn t think anything of it Pretty much we were trying to get our lives back on track I d say for the first year went to numerous wakes and funerals for a solid year of just firemen and cops and civilians who were killed It wasn t a pleasant time It was actually a time that I really don t care to remember too much I guess I ve repressed the memories and it s kind of hazy but I do remember enough Then we gradually built our lives back and life pretty much got back to normal even though you have the wars going on and you have All kinds of things were going on but people accepted it and we had to move on We had to carry on and we did Being in the construction industry I speak with a lot of people I was talking with some people and we were talking about building construction and we got onto talking about how the towers had collapsed Then one of the guys that I was talking with said You know about Building 7 I was like Well what about Building 7 What is it What was it I really didn t know too much about it I knew that a third building had come down but at the time you re watching this I guess I really started watching the news a couple of days after 9 11 when Franklin Square was called into the city and we had to do standby duty at a city firehouse We were all glued around the TV and they kept showing Building 7 from uptown like around the Empire State Building so you could see the building come down At the time nobody really cared about Building 7 because everybody was more fixated on the Twin Towers Then this person that I was speaking with another one of the construction workers he s like Yeah he goes that building came down It wasn t hit by a plane and I have some real good photos videos of it close up He started showing me that and then on one of the videos you could actually see the windows blowing out and the windows blew out on multiple floors all at the same time and then the building buckled on both ends and then the roof The roof had initially caved in but then the whole building came down symmetrically I just stood there and I looked at him I was like You ve got to be kidding me Where did you get that He s like It s on the web You could go online and you could bring up pictures of all of this That s what spurred my curiosity so I went online and I started researching pictures of the collapses I m looking at the collapses and then I m hitting different websites There s a lot of crap out there and there s a lot of people who are off the wall with all kinds of different theories about everything but I wasn t interested in that I was more interested in the dynamics of the collapse I looked at Building 7 in the closeup and then somebody had stitched together I guess some pictures of a controlled demolition and they put it side by side next to Building 7 Then I was looking at I was going through the interviews and then I was looking at the news reports There was a report from Dan Rather and he said he was watching Building 7 and how it reminded him of a controlled demolition I m looking at that building and now from a construction point of view and then from being a fireman and I m like There s something literally wrong with this picture because fire doesn t act like that If the building wasn t hit by a plane They said there were raging fires and there were no raging fires in Building 7 There was fires on a few floors and by the time of the collapse they had pretty much gone out There was damage when the North Tower collapse Okay I get that but the building would ve collapsed on the damaged side and it would ve been an asymmetrical collapse It wouldn t have been a symmetrical collapse Even if you look at the video of the building coming down it doesn t collapse from the top You see the roof coming down but it starts to collapse from the bottom All the core columns I know from construction all the core columns had to have been severed at the same time for a uniform symmetrical collapse like that There s no two ways about it never going to have a steel frame building collapse in that fashion without something else going on That spurred me on even further and I started looking into more videos Then I was interested in what eyewitnesses had to say because I don t I m not going on hearsay and I m not going on theories I want to know what people saw There s a lot of testimony there from the firemen and police first responders as to what they saw and they heard I believe about 200 or so mention explosions They saw red flashes There was a lot of popping explosions and everybody had pretty much There was a common theme They all said they thought it was It almost looked like a controlled demolition The people actually said that Then I m like all right but you know I m going through I m surfing the web and then I hit Architects and Engineers website and this website had it all together and it presented it in a logical fashion yeah all right this is what happened Then they back it up with professional people and they backed up by eyewitness testimony and how certain things are just not possible You can t suspend the laws of physics Gravity only operates downward It doesn t operate from outward The laws of science most certainly do apply The laws of the building the way the buildings were constructed that applies If you put theories to the test which they have then you prove that it s not really a theory anymore or you eliminate things that just are impossible to happen That coalesced in my mind Then after I would say two or three years of doing research and digging digging through testimony and looking at pictures and hitting various websites it pretty much was obvious that the official government narrative is not really what happened that day It s absolutely far from the truth and it s not a good thing What was done it was something It was terrible and it was perpetrated on the American public by I m just going to say a rogue group and there was an agenda There definitely was an agenda There was a lot going on and a lot of good people got killed That s something that this country cannot tolerate because it just goes against everything that we stand for People were murdered for that and that s something that You know what That really disturbs me and I know it disturbs a lot of other people too Steele Absolutely and I think you really lay out the evidence very well from your own research and perspective When you woke up to this through your slow process of deep research like so many of us did you speak to other people about this other firefighters What were their reactions I d also like to know what did this do to your world view Gioia When I first started talking to people about it they just kind of laughed it off and they were like you re crazy and you don t know what you re talking about They just kind of blew it off Then I would say Well wait a minute Look at these pictures with me You could see if you look at the Twin Towers exploding and really look below the collapse at the beginning you could actually see floors blowing out in a pattern coming down Then the debris from the collapsing floors covers it up but you can actually see the floors blowing out There s some really good pictures of that I would try to tell people that maybe it s not all as it seems and that there s definitely something else here that we need to look at Initially people didn t want to know and it is definitely a sensitive issues because we re pretty much right on top of it but I m persistent I brought it up to a few people and I showed them a few things to spur their curiosity I don t think it changed my world view I think that if anything I always knew that the other world was a crazy place Steele What first gave you the idea to pursue this resolution and how difficult was the decision for you to go ahead and broach this subject with your colleagues Gioia I have been putting it out there for a couple years now in the fire department Being commissioner I do go to meetings with other fire districts and being an ex chief I do go to meetings for chiefs The Chiefs Association in Nassau County I brought it up at a fire district meeting I actually read the petition I saw the petition I agreed with the need to have another investigation because a lot of evidence has surfaced in the past 18 years that needs to look at A lot of it has been uncovered by Architects and Engineers It s been uncovered by a lot of people who have taken the time to analyze and to render a professional opinion on what the evidence shows That to me was very important I started telling people about the petition I said that the U S Attorney for the Southern District of New York actually has this petition to get a grand jury investigation going I said That s where we need to go I said My feelings on the matter don t mean anything I said We re not engaging in conspiracy theories at all Let s look at the evidence and let the evidence guide us on the direction that we need to go That is so important I think that the American people I think that any rational person would agree with that that you discount everything else You can t go on hearsay Let s take a hard look at what s there and let that just guide us We owe it to the people who were murdered on 9 11 and the countless thousands or tens of thousands of people who were killed in these wars overseas in the name of fighting terrorism or whatever you want to call it and get to the heart of the matter and get to the truth If the evidence takes us in that direction and we do find out that there are other people responsible and they re in the government or if they re in the Pentagon or they re in the business sector then these people need to be held to account They need to be brought to justice We need to get this country back on track Steele Absolutely I couldn t agree with you more So much was affected by September 11th We re still living the ramifications of it to this day That s why so many people are dedicated and I can tell probably one of the reasons why you re so dedicated too I m curious about the interactions in discussing this resolution What was some of the feedback and discussion that took place before you guys actually met and passed this thing Gioia I approached the other commissioners and I said Listen I want to sponsor a resolution in support of the petition at the U S Attorney s Office The other commissioners were receptive They ve been in the fire service for many years We ve been intimately involved with everything with 9 11 and they know where I m coming from They know that I don t get myself involved in anything unless I believe in it 100 They looked They listened to what I had to say I said I d like to do introduce a resolution I said I looked it up and a resolution a legal resolution is It s not really binding It s pretty much mostly symbolic but it is a statement from a legislative group and where elected official is a statement that we recognize certain things and that we support the investigation Coming from a fire department that would lend some weight to the movement to get the U S Attorney s Office to present the petition which I understand they re not talking and they ve had it for about year That was the impetus on getting the resolution going That was just to add some weight and to add some considerable support to the movement that s out there I think we accomplished that The Franklin Square and Munson Fire District commissioners Philip F Malloy Jr left Dennis G Lyons second from left Joseph M Torregrossa center Christopher L Gioia second from right Les Saltzman right Steele You absolutely did Now I understand from the article that AE911Truth has posted and sent out to all of our supporters that you had family members of the fallen at this meeting Can you talk about that Gioia I invited Tommy Hetzel s parents his widow his sister and I invited my friend Bobby Evans His mom and his sister were there We had them sit there up front The family of Michael Kiefer they really took the hit because Mike was their shining star and I don t think they ever fully recovered from losing Michael He had a couple of sisters and whatnot I think he was the only son His was a real big loss over there I know that the Evans family definitely took the hit I know his mom His mom was devastated I just couldn t say enough about the Hetzel family because they ve been through so much There s been other tragedy in the family His mom and his dad and his brother and his sister his remaining siblings have been so strong throughout everything and I just can t imagine the strength that it takes for them to continue but they do Yes they were there for the vote on the resolution The Franklin Square and Munson Fire District commissioners greet the families of fallen firefighters Thomas J Hetzel and Robert Evans both Franklin Square natives Steele Obviously you re aware of how significant this was Again it s the first legislative body in the country to put forth such a resolution Were other commissioners in this body aware of the historic significance of this resolution Gioia I don t think they realized the full impact of what we were doing until after it was done They knew it was significant though because I told them Everything is transparent with the fire district One commissioner doesn t do anything without letting the other commissioners We don t operate independently and we do have a district council which oversees everything that we do and they guide us and they give legal advice on everything The resolution was drafted The commissioners we all had a chance to look at it It was run by counsel to make sure that the T s were crossed and the I s were dotted and that it was presented in a legal fashion Whether or not they knew the full impact of what the resolution was going to do I don t think any of us did I think we had a narrow focus and that was just to support the resolution and then to have this thing literally It got big real fast and I think that that took everybody including myself by surprise but no They knew it was going to have an impact but I don t think we all realized the tremendous impact that it was going to have Steele Us veterans in the movement are fully aware that many times those who don t want discussion of the evidence who don t want to talk about this issue that want to stifle any questions about September 11th will oftentimes try to invoke the firefighters and the emotional impact of that day on them to try to shut down the discussion What is your reaction to those kinds of methods to try to stifle discussion of the evidence Gioia I think it s a diversionary tactic I think that the psychological implications of 9 11 were definitely discussed and implemented that 9 11 was a very sophisticated attack and plot that it was very well planned and they covered all the bases To me it s like psychological warfare so if you constantly shift the focus from the facts to the dramatic effect then you ve been successful because now you ve taken the focus off where you need it to be I d just tell people listen I ve always said that 9 11 needs to be viewed from a clinical standpoint where you just disassociate yourself from all emotion and you just look at the facts and that s it You don t get involved in the drama You don t get involved in the emotion the feelings any of that That s a non sequitur That just has no bearing on what we re trying to do I tell people bluntly listen You know what This is a crime This was a mass murder That s what this was okay That s all it was It was a mass murder 3 000 people were murdered in cold blood on TV or in front of your eyes okay Buildings collapsed and planes crashed into this and all kinds of things happened We need to look at it and we have to put literally everything under the microscope Everything has to be looked at and analyzed It has to be analyzed from a scientific point of view and there s no emotion to it It s this and it s that If it s this then we need to go there If it s that we need to go there If you look at the evidence and you look at the testimony any reasonable person would say there s plenty of reasonable doubt there and you know what You can t violate the laws of physics and you can t say that steel frame buildings just collapse for no reason at free fall You just can t make these statements the way the government s throwing out these statements They didn t even want to entertain some of the evidence What they didn t want to look at they didn t look at To give you an example in the case of Building 7 they asked the gentleman who was giving the report Actually he came out and said he goes Oh there was no evidence of explosives found Then they asked him Well did you look for explosives He said No we didn t look for explosives How disingenuous is that that we didn t find explosives because we didn t look for explosives There s a lot of doublespeak going on Steele Now you ve passed this resolution You re getting a lot of attention on the Internet from alternative media and I think the corporate media is probably aware of this whether or not they choose to report it We all know the situation with them but do you think that other firemen who may hear about this particularly in New York City in the surrounding areas do you think they re ready to hear out this issue with an open mind or do you think the emotion of that day still carries 18 years later Gioia I think Andrew it cuts both ways I think you have firemen out there who actually are embracing this because they know that something s not right I know that for a fact because from the meetings that I ve attended with the chiefs the ex chiefs fire district commissioners from the other towns around Nassau County that there are people out there who do not accept the official narrative They know that something is wrong and they re absolutely willing to look at the evidence and they do want to see some movement They want to see another investigation because they know that things just don t add up You have some people who they re pretty much in denial and they don t want to go down that road anymore because they ve been affected so much that We ve been destroyed up here in New York We have We took the hit People they just You mention 9 11 and they go right into the shell They go right into a defensive posture Now that time has elapsed a little bit you have a younger crowd that wasn t really as much on top of it and they are willing to embrace the evidence and they re willing to embrace people who are talking about it because if you stick to the facts and that s all we need to do is just stick to the facts and say listen these are the facts and this is the evidence and we need to look at this then nobody s going to argue with that All right we need another investigation Let s talk about things Let s talk about this We re all adults We all have a stake in this There s no rational person out there that s going to tell me as a firemen You know what Oh we can t talk about that because I d be the first one to tell them You know what No You know what I m going to talk about it My friends were murdered They were murdered right in front of me You know what I want to get to the bottom of it so what are you telling me You going to tell me no you don t want an investigation What s up with that It s beyond belief that there are people out there that would not embrace a new investigation so we could get to the truth and we could look at evidence that hasn t been looked at and is mandated by Congress that they have to show this evidence and it s mandated by law that the U S Attorney has to present this to a grand jury That s the rule of law and that s what this country is all about That s what makes this country what it is That s what sets this country apart from other countries in the world is that we have respect for law and order There is the rule of law and that has been violated It s been grossly violated and we need to get back to that because if we do not get back to the rule of law then this country the ideals everything that this country has been built on is going to take the hit You know what I don t think you re going to let it happen I know damn sure I m not going to let it happen Steele Those are powerful words and I know that there are other firemen out there all over America who have gotten wind of what happened in the Franklin Square and Munson Fire District and are maybe even listening to this interview wanting to meet the man who proposed that resolution They may be inspired but they may be holding back for various reasons They may want to do the same thing in their fire districts maybe other fire commissioners with that authority What would you say to them as they re considering this What would you say to them in terms of why it s so important and why they should pursue the same action that your district did Gioia Andrew I would say this to the other firefighters to the police officers to anybody any other person out there any American that you know what We re all Americans here and we believe in ideals which make our country great There comes a point in everyone s life when you have to make a stand and that s a really tough thing to do for people You make a decision that you know what You re going to stand up for something Now a lot of people talk tough and a lot of people they just That s it They re just talk and they don t really act and back it up with actions but it s incumbent on especially firemen We ve taken the extra step We ve gone the extra mile We re out there protecting lives and saving property and we re on the forefront of all of this I would say to anybody who believes in this country that it s time to make a stand because 3 000 people were murdered and you can t let this go You re not going to let it go because if they re going to murder 3 000 people what are they going to do next I m not going to have my kids jeopardized I don t really like how the country has been guided down this dark path We need to get back on track and it s up to the people in this country the good people Americans to me aren t afraid to stand up for what they believe in We ve been so beaten down that you know what You re afraid to speak because God forbid they re going to say Oh you re a hater or You re a racist or You re a truther or something like that You know what I m not afraid to get out there and speak my mind You know you speak intelligently and you speak armed with the facts but you know what You have to speak People really need to make a stand on this one because if we don t if we don t then something else even worse is going to happen because it only emboldens things like this to happen I think there s a quote It says For evil to triumph good people need not do anything That is so true so it depends on the person I would just encourage people out there listen if you feel strongly about this then do something about it Don t sit there Get up and do something about it because there s a lot of people out there that will help you that ll embrace this Like you said there s a movement out there of people who just for whatever reason they just don t believe what we ve been told The more you look at it you could see the truth I tell people listen I m not going to tell you how to think okay I m not going to tell you one way or the other about what happened on 9 11 You do that yourself You look at it You research it You come to your own conclusions all right Then maybe a few months or a year down the road we could meet up again and we could talk about it and see if your position has changed We need to get behind the investigation People need to get behind this and get the investigation going and let the wheels of justice do their job Steele Something I always commonly mention or I have been doing for the past year or so is we re here 18 years after this event took place If the post 9 11 world were a person it would be old enough to vote at this point or I guess it would be this September so it s been a long time Some people say why do you keep at this It was so long ago Maybe it was a controlled demolition Maybe it wasn t but all those people or most of them are out of office now Why can t we just move forward Why do we have to focus on the negative I mean this is an attitude that exists out there among the rank and file of America I hear it often What s your response to that What do you have to say to those sentiments Gioia I hear the same thing Andrew I hear it It s 18 years later Why are you bothering I say to these people because these people were our friends They were our neighbors They were sons They were daughters They were husbands They were wives They had lives These were Americans who went to work They just were going about their business and they died horrible deaths These were my friends and I m not going to forget that I m not satisfied with the way they ve been treated Like I said reinvestigate I get choked up I get emotional I would get emotional with people and just say listen unless you ve lost somebody and I always say listen if somebody murdered somebody in your family and there was evidence that came about after that pointed at somebody else or it took you in a different direction wouldn t you want to pursue that There s no statute of limitation on murder and these people were murdered That s why after 18 years I m still looking for justice for my friends because I know that there are people out there who need to be held to account I m not going to let go I m not going to let go If I spend the rest of my life pursuing this pursuing justice for my friends I m going to do that Now with regards to that being a fireman and being a firefighter This is for all of the firemen out there You know it s a brotherhood and we ve been trained that when you fight the fire you go in You don t go in alone You go in with your brother or your sister You go in together and if something happens you come out together You don t leave that person behind so I
