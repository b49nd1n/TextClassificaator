 While December answered one of the burning questions facing traders namely where approximately is the Powell Put or the level where the Federal Reserve will abandon monetary prudence and flip from hawkish to dovish another question still remains i e where is the Trump Put or the price level below whichthe US president will not engage in further trade war escalation To be sure the history of the US administration s rhetoric and actions on trade policy over the last 18 months clearly suggests the state of the equity markets played a role Consider the following observations from Deutsche Bank s Binkhy Chadha This can all be summarized by two charts the first showing the locus of major escalations which tend to cluster at market tops while there are virtually no trade war escalations when the S P is below 2 650 Meanwhile all selloffs are followed by de escalations So is there a Trump put when the S P drops below 2650 While escalations and de escalations on trade occurred at a variety of levels and trajectories of the S P 500 and they were clearly not the only driver Deutsche Bank notes several empirical regularities Is the level of the S P the only trigger to watch for trade war de escalation No in Chadha s view a more likely imminent trigger for sustained de escalation is the state of US manufacturing where the Trump bump to the ISM has already been wiped out and prospects are for continued declines taking it to recession levels Deutsche Bank explains In October 2016 the month before the presidential election the ISM manufacturing index in its early stages of recovery from the prior US dollar and oil shocks printed 51 7 It then rose to 58 60 by the summer of 2017 and stayed there for about 15 months in what was unusually sustained period of growth at high levels Since the slowdown began in November last year the ISM has been falling sharply and has already fallen to 52 1 while new export orders which have been leading the headline continue to point down So the Trump bump to manufacturing in the US which takes place in many swing states has already petered out As a result a continued decline and in particular a falling below 50 will be hard to spin as anything but a manufacturing recession It may thus force Trump to once again concede to China in hopes of sparking a fresh rebound But besides the stock market and the state of US manufacturing arguably most critical for the de escalation calculus are the President s job approval ratings but as DB correctly notes these are unlikely to fall until the trade war begins to impact consumer goods sourced from China or Mexico One can therefore argue that the lightning rod for the administration to de escalate would be a decline in approval ratings But there is a major risk here approval ratings tend to be slow moving and so far the impacts have fallen largely on corporates It is also notable that President Trump s approval ratings did not respond to the large declines in the stock market in Q4 last year even though with a lag consumer confidence did But the subsequent government shut down did see his approval ratings fall arguably with a lag as it began to impact public services such as TSA related delays at airports So approval ratings may not fall until tariffs or supply issues associated with imports begin to impact the prices of US consumer goods from China which in turn will only happen months after Trump enables tariffs on the last 4th tranche which will include tariffs on virtually all Chinese imports At that point it just may be too late to hope for a graceful concession as both Trump and Xi will be way too deep in their war of personalities and the hit to Trump s approval rating may be far greater if he is perceived as waving a white flag in the trade war than if he simply maintains a strategy which ends up pushing stocks into a bear market and the economy into a recession Appendix A a history of trade related escalations and de escalations by the White House Appendix B a history of Fed related Trump tweets
