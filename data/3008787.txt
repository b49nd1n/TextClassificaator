 Worse than Watergate is how Rep Adam Schiff described the Mueller Report s findings as he doubled down or is it quadrupled on his fantasy dissonance about The Man In The White House Well I think it s clear from the Mueller report that that s exactly right The obstruction of justice in particular in this case is far worse than anything that Richard Nixon did The the break in by the Russians of the Democratic institutions a foreign adversary far more significant than the plumbers breaking into the Democratic headquarters So yes I would say in every way this is more significant than Watergate And the fact that a candidate for president and now president of the United States would not only not stand up and resist Russian interference in our election but would welcome it goes well beyond anything Nixon did The fact that the president of the United States would take Putin s side over his own intelligence agencies go well beyond anything Richard Nixon did So yes I think it is far more serious than Watergate So it is with great irony that the previously outspokenly anti Trump journalist and Watergate exposer Bob Woodward sees things quite differently to Schiff During an interview with Fox News s Chris Wallace Woodward said Sunday that the FBI and CIA s reliance on the Steele dossier needs to be investigated now that the Mueller reported has undercut many of the salacious document s claims What I found out recently which was really quite surprising the dossier which really has got a lot of garbage in it and Mueller found that to be the case early in building the intelligence community assessment on Russian interference in an early draft they actually put the dossier on page two in kind of a breakout box I think it was the CIA pushing this Real intelligence experts looked at this and said no this is not intelligence this is garbage and they took it out said Woodward But in this process the idea that they would include something like that in one of the great stellar intelligence assessments as Mueller also found out is highly questionable Needs to be investigated As The Daily Caller s Chuck Ross notes the Justice Department s inspector general is reportedly investigating the FBI s handling of the dossier which was used to obtain surveillance warrants against former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page
