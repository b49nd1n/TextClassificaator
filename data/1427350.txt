 Last night after Trump launched yet another furious tweetstorm intended to expose the double standard applied in the Hillary investigation compared to the Russia probe we noted that Republicans might be well served to stop sitting around twiddling their thumbs and actually go on the offensive against an investigation that has obviously morphed into mass hysteria courtesy of free flowing leaks from a conflicted intelligence community intent upon bringing down a presidency Here s what we said Of course until someone within the Trump administration or Republican Party smartens up and calls for the appointment of a Special Counsel to look into Hillary s email scandal something that should have been done long ago and not for retaliatory reasons but simply due to Comey s and AG Lynch s blatant mishandling of the investigation a point which Deputy AG Rosenstein obviously agreed with the Democrats have no reason to calm their mass hysteria Then and only then do we suspect that Hillary might just be able to convince her party to exercise some form of reasonable judgement Now according to a note this morning from The Hill Republicans seem to be doing just that with several members of the GOP calling on the Special Counsel to look into whether former Attorney General Loretta Lynch illegally meddled in the Hillary investigation when she met with Bill Clinton on the tarmac in Phoenix and or instructed Comey to refer to his case as a matter rather than an investigation Rather than wasting resources on investigating Trump the GOP says the special counsel must look into whether former attorney general Loretta Lynch meddled with the FBI s criminal investigation into Hillary Clinton s email server Comey testified that Lynch told him to downplay the seriousness of the FBI s email server investigation For those who missed it here is Comey s testimony in which he confirms that Lynch directed him to refer to the Hillary email case as a matter rather than an investigation not to mention that ill advised meeting with Bill Clinton on the Phoenix tarmac just days before the Justice Department was set to announce the results of their investigation Now and perhaps because of a recent attack which targeted Republicans and in which the shooter seemed to be fueled by rage from largely fake anonymously sourced new stories it appears that the GOP is finally starting to push back These special counsels have a way of going off the rails Rep Trent Franks R Az told The Hill And the ostensible purpose of the special counsel has now been essentially vitiated and everybody knows that And so they ve got to try to find something to do In this case it was almost the intent from the beginning to try to create something out of nothing And it doesn t work in physics but in politics it seems to be pretty effective This is the most coordinated communications effort on behalf of the president that we ve seen in a long time said Barry Bennett a former adviser to Trump They need it it s tough to fight nameless faceless quotes from people purposefully twisting these stories on you Trump s lead outside counsel Mark Kasowitz responded to the Post story by decrying the illegal leaks which he said had come directly from the FBI Jay Sekulow a new member of Trump s legal team went on Fox News Channel to say that the leaks may have come from inside Mueller s special counsel Sekulow asked why the FBI is not sending agents to people s houses to put an end to it Meanwhile the Republican National Committee which chairwoman Ronna McDaniel has described as the political arm of the White House has led the effort to cast doubt on the special counsel investigation Of course Trump has been fairly direct and open with his feelings about the ongoing witch hunt They made up a phony collusion with the Russians story found zero proof so now they go for obstruction of justice on the phony story Nice Donald J Trump realDonaldTrump June 15 2017 You are witnessing the single greatest WITCH HUNT in American political history led by some very bad and conflicted people MAGA Donald J Trump realDonaldTrump June 15 2017 Crooked H destroyed phones w hammer bleached emails had husband meet w AG days before she was cleared they talk about obstruction Donald J Trump realDonaldTrump June 15 2017 Meanwhile as we noted earlier this morning even Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein has grown weary of the constant leaks and what they mean for the credibility of Special Counsel Mueller s investigation which seems to have prompted him to release the following statement Americans should exercise caution before accepting as true any stories attributed to anonymous officials particularly when they do not identify the country let alone the branch or agency of government with which the alleged sources supposedly are affiliated Americans should be skeptical about anonymous allegations The Department of Justice has a long established policy to neither confirm nor deny such allegations Of course it s only a matter of time until the Washington Post uses to the Republican fury to allege guilt afterall why would they attempt to fight back if they re innocent Surely it can t have anything to do with the barrage of anonymously sourced fake news stories released daily with the sole intent of bringing down a Republican President while never producing a shred of actual evidence
