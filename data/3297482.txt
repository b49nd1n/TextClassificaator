 Back in September we reported that TV network OAN had filed a lawsuit against Rachel Maddow for the time the host said that OAN really literally is paid Russian propaganda Now Maddow finds herself having to come up with a defense for her statement in court And she has also apparently hired Lionel Hutz as her legal adviser According to Culttture her lawyers argued in a recent motion that the liberal host was clearly offering up her own unique expression of her views to capture what she saw as the ridiculous nature of the undisputed facts Her comment therefore is a quintessential statement of rhetorical hyperbole incapable of being proved true or false Oh it s capable of being proved false alright Maddow had previously claimed on air about one of OAN s reporters In this case the most obsequiously pro Trump right wing news outlet in America is really literally is paid Russian propaganda and added Their on air politics reporter Kristian Rouz is paid by the Russian government to produce propaganda for that government The testimony of UC Santa Barbara linguistics professor Stefan Thomas Gries however stands at odds with Maddow s defense Gries said It is very unlikely that an average or reasonable ordinary viewer would consider the sentence in question to be a statement of opinion Gries continued I am the second most widely cited cognitive linguist and sixth most widely cited living corpus linguist The field of cognitive linguistics draws from both linguistics and psychology and studies how language interacts with cognition OAN had filed the defamation suit in federal court in San Diego according to AP OAN is a small family owned conservative network that is based in San Diego and has received favorable Tweets from the President It is seen as a competitor to Fox News OAN s lawsuit claims that Maddow s comments were retaliation after OAN President Charles Herring accused Comcast of censorship The suit said that Comcast refuses to carry its channel because counters the liberal politics of Comcast s own news channel MSNBC It was about a week after Herring e mailed a Comcast executive when Maddow opened her show by referring to a Daily Beast report that claimed an OAN employee also worked for Sputnik News which has ties to the Russian government Maddow said In this case the most obsequiously pro Trump right wing news outlet in America really literally is paid Russian propaganda Their on air U S politics reporter is paid by the Russian government to produce propaganda for that government Except Maddow likely still upset from spending 3 years trying to promulgate a Russian hoax that didn t exist didn t quite get her facts straight Big surprise
