 Submitted by Market Crumbs The retail price of one pound of bananas in the United States was 58 cents in 2018 Right now you can order one banana on Walmart s website for 18 cents You can also order one roll of 3M Multi Use Duct Tape for 4 99 on Amazon Why the hell would you want a banana and duct tape Apparently because duct taping a banana to a wall is all the rage in the world of high end art This may sound like something out of The Onion but this week at Art Basel Miami Beach a banana duct taped to a wall sold for 120 000 Even worse a second banana duct taped to a wall sold for 120 000 Yet even worse than that a third banana duct taped to a wall is expected to sell for 150 000 because art Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan is the artist behind the banana which was sourced from a local Miami supermarket that is aptly named Comedian The first two editions of the banana duct taped to a wall reportedly sold to two different French buyers A third edition of the banana duct taped to a wall already had two institutions express interest according to the gallery handling the sale Perrotin Despite Cattelan being known as an art world prankster the gallery said the piece is not a joke Every aspect of the work was carefully considered from the shape of the fruit to the angle its been affixed with duct tape to the wall said Perrotin In a sign of how those who are privy to the world of fine art will say anything to sound sophisticated one attendee said It s best of show Cattelan worked on the idea for Comedian for about a year creating versions in both bronze and resin Wherever I was traveling I had this banana on the wall I couldn t figure out how to finish it Cattelan said Finally Cattelan had an epiphany saying In the end one day I woke up and I said the banana is supposed to be a banana The price was determined by coming up with an insignificant number that would trivialize the work and an outlandish one that would be completely ridiculous So what s stopping everyone from selling a duct taped banana to a wall for 120 000 Perrotin said Without the artist s certificate of authenticity it reverts to being just a banana So while this could be an actual sale money laundering a prank PR move or anything else it s a reminder of how some people have more money than brains Either way it provided a good laugh for those who are not fortunate enough to drop 120 000 on a banana duct taped to a wall
