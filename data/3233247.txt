 Submitted by Nick Colas of DataTrek Research Social unrest seems to be cropping up all over the world from Hong Kong to Bolivia and Lebanon we offer up a 3 variable model to help explain why The inputs urbanization income inequality and average age Every country currently seeing mass protests has some combination of high levels of the first two and lower readings for the last This admitted crude measure also explains why many developed countries political environments also seem so fraught at the moment Long time readers may recall I occasionally take strange vacations Over the last 30 years I have been all over Syria Lebanon and most recently Afghanistan in 2013 I once drove around rural Turkey for a week just taking in the sights It wasn t until we encountered an army checkpoint outside a small village that questions about safety popped up Curiosity is the only reason I can offer for these offbeat excursions It s one thing to read about troubled countries but once you get there you see the universal truth that travel always illuminates People are pretty much the same everywhere Since there seems to be an outbreak of global protest at the moment these are the subject of this week s Story Time Thursday A partial list of the countries in question Much of the news commentary around these events centers on country specific issues but I see 3 threads that weave through most or all of them urbanization income inequality and average age Perhaps that s just my own worldview that people are the same everywhere but let s see how far it takes us in explaining current events Here is the percent of each country that lives in around cities using World Bank urbanization data And here is the Gini coefficient by country from the CIA World Factbook the higher the number the greater the income inequality Finally here is the average age of each country also from CIA data The logic behind why these measures indicate a potential for unrest We can even make a crude model for how these inputs might interrelate Add the urbanization rate and Gini coefficient and divide by average age and you get You re probably wondering how the US and other major economies rank and despite the fact that our simple model leaves out important inputs like a history of democratic institutions and the rule of law we won t leave you hanging One can tell an infinite number of stories about how these metrics inform each country s proclivity for unpredictable political outcomes even if they don t rise to the perilous levels of the 6 countries we highlighted In the interest of respecting your time I will leave you to develop those narratives for yourself Summing up as investors we are trained to look for common patterns that explain outcomes and that is what this exercise tries to accomplish when it comes to country specific political events Language and culture may vary but people are essentially the same everywhere Sources World Bank urbanization rates https data worldbank org indicator SP URB TOTL in zs CIA Factbook Gini coefficients https www cia gov library publications the world factbook rankorder 2172rank html CIA Factbook median age https www cia gov library publications the world factbook fields 343rank html
