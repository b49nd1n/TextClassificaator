 Authored by Michael Snyder via The Economic Collapse blog Since the end of the last recession the outlook for the U S economy has never been as dire as it is right now Everywhere you look economic red flags are popping up and the mainstream media is suddenly full of stories about the coming recession After several years of relative economic stability things appear to be changing dramatically for the U S economy and the global economy as a whole Over and over again we are seeing things happen that we have not witnessed since the last recession and many analysts expect our troubles to accelerate as we head into the final months of 2019 We should certainly hope that things will soon turn around but at this point that does not appear likely The following are 28 signs of economic doom as the pivotal month of September begins 1 The U S and China just slapped painful new tariffs on one another thus escalating the trade war to an entirely new level 2 JPMorgan Chase is projecting that the trade war will cost the average U S household 1 000 per year 3 Yield curve inversions have preceded every single U S recession since the 1950s and the fact that it has happened again is one of the big reasons why Wall Street is freaking out so much lately 4 We just witnessed the largest decline in U S consumer sentiment in 7 years 5 Mortgage defaults are rising at the fastest pace that we have seen since the last financial crisis 6 Sales of luxury homes valued at 1 5 million or higher were down five percentduring the second quarter of 2019 7 The U S manufacturing sector has contracted for the very first time since September 2009 8 The Cass Freight Index has been falling for a number of months According to CNBC it fell 5 9 in July following a 5 3 decline in June and a 6 drop in May 9

last recession 11 The price of copper often gives us a clear indication of where the economy is heading and it is now down 13 percent over the last six months 12 When it looks like an economic crisis is coming investors often flock to precious metals So it is very interesting to note that the price of gold is up more than 20 percent since May 13 Women s clothing retailer Forever 21 is reportedly close to filing for bankruptcy protection 14 We just learned that Sears and Kmart will close nearly 100 additional stores by the end of this year 15 Domestic shipments of RVs have fallen an astounding 20 percent so far in 2019 16 The Labor Department has admitted that the U S economy actually has 501 000 less jobs than they previously thought 17 S P 500 earnings per share estimates have been steadily falling all year long 18 Morgan Stanley says that the possibility that we will see a global recession is high and rising 19 Global trade fell 1 4 percent in June from a year earlier and that was the biggest drop that we have seen since the last recession 20 The German economy contracted during the second quarter and the German central bank is predicting the third quarter will also post a decline 21 According to CNBC the S P 500 just sent a screaming sell signal to U S investors 22 Masanari Takada is warning that we could soon see a Lehman like plunge in the stock market 23 Corporate insiders are dumping stocks at a pace that we haven t seen in more than a decade 24 Apple CEO Tim Cook has been dumping millions of dollars worth of Apple stock 25 Instead of pumping his company s funds into the stock market Warren Buffett has decided to hoard 122 billion dollars in cash This appears to be a clear indication that he believes that a crisis is coming 26 Investors are selling their shares in emerging markets funds at a pace that we have never seen before 27 The Economic Policy Uncertainty Index hit the highest level that we have ever seen in the month of June 28 Americans are searching Google for the term recession more frequently than we have seen at any time since 2009 The signs are very clear but unfortunately we live at a time when normalcy bias is rampant in our society If you are not familiar with normalcy bias the following is how Wikipedia defines it The normalcy bias or normality bias is a belief people hold when considering the possibility of a disaster It causes people to underestimate both the likelihood of a disaster and its possible effects because people believe that things will always function the way things normally have functioned This may result in situations where people fail to adequately prepare themselves for disasters and on a larger scale the failure of governments to include the populace in its disaster preparations About 70 of people reportedly display normalcy bias in disasters 1 For most Americans the crisis of 2008 and 2009 is now a distant memory and the vast majority of the population seems confident that brighter days are ahead even if we must weather a short term economic recession first As a result most people are not preparing for a major economic crisis and that makes us extremely vulnerable In 2008 and 2009 the horrible financial crisis and the bitter recession that followed took most Americans completely by surprise It will be the same this time around even though the warning signs are there for all to see
