 German Medical Doctor Katrin Korb discusses COVID 19 the lockdown and the vaccine during a protest held in Oldeburg Below is the transcript of her speech Dear fellow citizens I m thankful for being able to stand here today My name is Katrin Korb I have 3 children and I m a doctor here in Oldenburg I m standing here because I feel the responsibility for the health of my parents my children and myself I stand here because I am furious about the attempts to get more control over people by attacking them with fear I am not sure what happens exactly though I m sure it has to do with money and power Firstly I recognize this principle It s the principle of our health care system A system which unfortunately is guilty of spreading fear in order to earn money This fear is on both our sides my side as a doctor but also my patients There are guidelines I have to follow guidelines for various health problems But who is writing these guidelines I will give you an example There is a European guideline for heart diseases There are 25 different authors who draft these guidelines 19 of which are funded by the pharmaceutical industry They call it an advisory fee The guidelines state that I must prescribe medications that have a lot of side effects but that do not make people better This makes a lot of money If I don t follow these guidelines and something happens to these people for example the situation is deteriorating for whatever reason then I will be held responsible for that So fear is cultivated so that I have to act against my professional beliefs The sick people are also frightened if you do not take these pills you will have a heart attack Then you will become even sicker Listen to me I can know I studied for it You are not sensible enough to think for yourself There is therefore no room to discuss this As a result people fear taking this medication day after day week to week year to year which makes a lot of money That s the way Since the beginning of this corona virus we have been kept in a kind of shock from the frightening messages Our governments say there is a new virus so terribly dangerous that millions will die if we don t protect you We know best what is good for you because we have experts You cannot make a decision for yourself You are too stupid for that We have to isolate you take away your rights and silent you by putting on a muzzle But we really do this for your protection We frighten you so much every day through the most horrible reports that you won t even dare to ask yourself if it s all right The mantra of the authorities is Only when we have a vaccination can we return to a normal In other words only a vaccination can give us back our fundamental rights This week Mrs von den Leyen EU has collected E 7 4 billion worldwide for the development and distribution of such a vaccine Also Germany has paid E525 000 Normally the development of such a vaccination takes years That s because security investigations need to be done This new virus from the corona family was discovered less than six months ago but experiments with MRNA are already being tried on humans This is unknown genetic material that will be injected into our cells You don t have to be a doctor to get an ominous feeling about this I will not be vaccinated I will not get my children vaccinated and I will also advise my patients not to do this Paragraph Two of the Constitution does NOT specify RIGHT TO HEALTH but right to physical integrity That is a very big difference So there is no right to health Being sick is part of our human life but no one should inflict physical harm on us even with a dubious vaccine We are the ones paying for this We already pay for the scientific and social impact of the lockdowns OUR TAX MONEY is spent for this And a vaccine must be financed with our tax money Already E 525 million German tax money and this is only the beginning Are we being asked if we want to do this Are we asked if we want to pay for Lockdowns NO All this money the taxes we ve paid we want that to be spent on other things For good education for our children for the development of new technologies for the environment for decent wages for employees in our vital professionals For immigration of people who fled from the war For sports culture etc etc This list is endless In short for things that make and keep people healthy But with this no money can be made We are in a crisis What is the way out of this crisis The victory over fear is the way out of this crisis People who can think for themselves being creative take responsibility for themselves working on their own health and the health of our world People who are positive who have friends who enjoy life do not get sick easily And if they do get sick they eventually unite with death Knowing that life in this world will ever end and are at peace with it You can t scare these kinds of people You have no power over these people This body has only been borrowed and someday I will have to give it back But as long as I live in this body as long as I feel think and act it will be MY body I am responsible for that and no one else MY BODY which I treat in the way I think is right I do not wish to return to the old normal I wish for a new better normal With free and self determined people who are responsible for themselves I believe many of us are here together with the same wish This gives me hope and I thank you Note to readers please click the share buttons above or below Forward this article to your email lists Crosspost on your blog site internet forums etc
