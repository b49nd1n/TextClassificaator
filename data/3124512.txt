 Submitted by Michael Every of Rabobank The First Cut Is The Weakest I would have given you all of my mark to market but there s someone who s torn it apart And he s taking just all that I had but if you wanna try to buy again Baby I ll try to buy again but I know The first cut is the weakest baby I know The first cut is the weakest But when it comes to being lucky he s cursed When it comes to lovin Trump he s worse With apologies to Sheryl Crow and none to the Fed what a mess The FOMC cut 25bp yesterday despite starting the year planning further hikes despite ultra low unemployment and despite their own general admission that everything is basically awesome Yet we ended the day with stocks lower the US yield curve viciously flattening most so 2 30s and the USD at a 2 year high A trend that doesn t surprise us Mission mis accomplished Mr Powell What was the Fed s key error As our Fed whisperer Philip Marey points out here basically the Fed Chair tried to make the case in his press conference that this was not the start of a proper easing cycle but rather just a mid cycle adjustment where rates could even go back up again at some point rather than just down down and down as the market wanted to hear NB You don t not give the market what it wants or at least you don t and keep your job Immediately following the Fed cut and market wobbly President Trump tweeted What the Market wanted to hear from Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve was that this was the beginning of a lengthy and aggressive rate cutting cycle which would keep pace with China The European Union and other countries around the world As usual Powell let us down but at least he is ending quantitative tightening which shouldn t have started in the first place no inflation We are winning anyway but I am certainly not getting much help from the Federal Reserve Trump would probably have been happier if there had been a 50bp cut as in Brazil on which note see Maurico Oreng s coverage here or perhaps even a 425bp cut as was last seen in Turkey Regardless our view remains the Fed will be dragged into a full blown rate cutting cycle once it s too late to prevent a US recession in 2020 If that wasn t enough for markets to fret about over in Shanghai the US China trade talks ended early with no results whatsoever Indeed the official stage managed group photo released post meeting was taken in front of a wall covered in ancient Chinese poetry I am reliably informed implies It would be nice to have it but we can live without it and we will persevere True the Tweet happy editor of China s Global Times let us know that in his view it was an efficient and constructive deep exchange but to my mind that is probably a script like this LIGHTHIZER Are you ready to make deep changes to the Chinese economy LIU HE No Are you ready to drop tariffs to allow more constructive market access for China LIGHTHIZER No LIU HE OK at least that was efficient Let s take a photo and you can go home Of course our view remains that there is no real trade deal to be done even if the two sides meet again in September and that s also a strong USD story Meanwhile there were other things happening yesterday The US is apparently not going to remove waivers on foreign firms involved in Iran s civilian nuclear program which eases tensions a little but it is going to personally sanction Iranian Foreign Minister Zariff after all Iran itself is about to drop three zeroes from its struggling Rial which US sanctions have crushed and rename the currency the Toman Same same but different as the Thais say The US senate is also pressing ahead with a bill to put sanctions on any firms involved in building Nordstream 2 and Turkstream the new gas pipelines Russia has been pressing ahead with to bring supplies to Europe while circumventing Ukraine That s yet another potential US EU clash brewing which an EU economy growing at 1 1 y y and with core CPI at 1 1 y y is of course ideally placed for In Asia China has banned individual travel to Taiwan for its citizens starting from today in a demonstration of what strong arm trade tactics really look like who will be next to feel that cosh one wonders Luckily Bloomberg reports of the PLA massing on Hong Kong s border in Guangdong were wrong it is merely 190 000 police officers including helicopters and armoured vehicles who are marching up and down in a warm up for the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People s Republic a long long way from Beijing where these things usually happen All a coincidence of course as Hong Kong heads to more protests this weekend and rumours of a general strike on Monday Meanwhile the HKMA has happily cut rates to follow the Fed having not really raised rates much most of the time the Fed has been doing so But it s hardly alone in that now is it
