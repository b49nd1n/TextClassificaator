 Hidden almost all the way in the end of the first chapter of the IMF s latest Financial Stability Report is a surprisingly candid discussion on the topic of whether Rising Medium Term Vulnerabilities Could Derail the Global Recovery which is a politically correct way of saying is the financial system on the verge of crashing In the section also called Global Financial Dislocation Scenario because crash sounds just a little too pedestrian the IMF uses a DSGE model to project the current global financial sitution and ominously admits that concerns about a continuing buildup in debt loads and overstretched asset valuations could have global economic repercussions and in modeling out the next crash pardon dislocation the IMF conducts a scenario analysis to illustrate how a repricing of risks could lead to a rise in credit spreads and a fall in capital market and housing prices derailing the economic recovery and undermining financial stability From the IMF s Financial Statbility Report Could Rising Medium Term Vulnerabilities Derail the Global Recovery This section illustrates how shocks to individual credit and financial markets well within historical norms can propagate and lead to larger global impacts because of knock on effects a dearth of policy buffers and extreme starting points in debt levels and asset valuations A sudden uncoiling of compressed risk premiums declines in asset prices and rises in volatility would lead to a global financial downturn With monetary policy in several advanced economies at or close to the effective lower bound the economic consequences would be magnified by the limited scope for monetary stimulus Indeed monetary policy normalization would be stalled in its tracks and reversed in some cases The Global Macrofinancial Model documented in Vitek 2017 is used to assess the consequences of a continued buildup in debt and an extended rise in risky asset prices from already elevated levels in some cases This dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model covers 40 economies and features extensive macro financial linkages with both bank and capital market based financial intermediation as well as diverse spillover channels This scenario has two phases The first phase features a continuation of low volatility and compressed spreads Equity and housing prices continue to climb in overheated markets As collateral values rise bank lending conditions adjust to maintain steady loan to value ratios facilitating favorable bank lending rates and more credit growth As discussed leverage in the nonfinancial private sector has already increased over the past decade across major advanced and emerging market economies In the scenario a further loosening in lending conditions combined with low default rates and low volatility leads investors to drift beyond their traditional risk limits as the search for yield intensifies despite increases in policy rates As presented earlier market and credit risk premiums are close to decade low levels leaving markets exposed to a decompression of risk premiums Thus the second phase begins with a rapid decompression of credit spreads and declines of up to 15 and 9 percent in equity and house prices respectively starting at the beginning of 2020 This shift reflects debt levels breaching critical thresholds prompting markets to grow concerned about debt sustainability while risk premiums jump aggravating deleveraging pressures As risk premiums rise debt servicing pressures are revealed as high debt to income ratios make borrowers more vulnerable to shocks The asset repricing is moderate in magnitude but is broad based across jurisdictions and leads to a tightening of financial conditions Flight to quality flows reduce long term bond yields in safe havens and raise them in the rest of the world Segments with higher leverage and extended valuations are hit particularly hard leading to higher funding costs and debt servicing strains Underlying vulnerabilities are exposed and the global recovery is interrupted Figure 1 30 summarizes the main impacts and spillovers Emerging Markets Would Suffer a Retrenchment in Foreign Capital Inflows Drawing on the above scenario the potential for emerging market stress due to pressures on portfolio inflows is examined in more detail including by taking into account the likely reduction in these flows from Federal Reserve balance sheet normalization as discussed earlier The buildup in external financing pressures could be particularly challenging for countries with large and rising projected current account deficits For example Colombia South Africa and Turkey have projected current account deficits in the range of 3 to 4Â½ percent of GDP in 2019 Figure 1 31 panel 3 Moreover emerging market currencies would come under pressure limiting space for monetary policy to ease In turn higher domestic interest rates would affect firms debt servicing capacity hitting those with still high levels of corporate leverage and increasing risks to weaker banking systems Emerging Market Policies In emerging market economies policymakers should take advantage of current favorable external conditions to further enhance their resilience including by continuing to strengthen external positions where needed and reduce corporate leverage where it is high Deploying policy buffers and exchange rate flexibility would help buffer external shocks while improving corporate debt restructuring mechanisms and monitoring firms foreign exchange exposures would lower corporate vulnerabilities Advances in these areas would leave these economies better placed to cushion any reduction in capital inflows that may occur from monetary policy normalization in advanced economies However capital outflow pressures could become more significant if there is a severe retrenchment in global risk appetite as in the scenario described earlier Such pressures should usually be handled primarily with macroeconomic structural and financial policies although the appropriate response will differ across countries depending on available policy space see IMF 2012 2015 2016a Where appropriate exchange rate flexibility should be a key shock absorber but in countries with sufficient international reserves foreign exchange intervention can be useful to prevent disorderly market conditions In periods of stress liquidity provision may also be needed to support the orderly functioning of financial markets Capital flow management measures should be implemented only in crisis situations or when a crisis is considered imminent and should not substitute for any needed macroeconomic adjustment When circumstances warrant the use of such measures on outflows they should be transparent temporary and nondiscriminatory and should be lifted once crisis conditions abate
