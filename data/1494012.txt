 CNN s perpetually triggered White House correspondent Jim Acosta has just decided to publicly share yet another personal melt down over twitter Apparently Acosta is sad that he flew all the way to Poland and didn t get to ask a question at the President s press conference Moreover Acosta seems to be of the opinion that any press briefing that fails to incorporate the views of CNN is by definition a fake news conference Trump finally held a news conference overseas But he took a question from a friendly reporter and then attacked CNN as fake news Isn t it a fake news conference to take a question from a reporter who is essentially an ally of the White House One of the questions came from a reporter who acknowledged he had just talked to WH about a job last month Trump finally held a news conference overseas But he took a question from a friendly reporter and then attacked CNN as fake news Jim Acosta Acosta July 6 2017 Isn t it a fake news conference to take a question from a reporter who is essentially an ally of the White House https t co vD7DgAZXIv Jim Acosta Acosta July 6 2017 One of the questions came from a reporter who acknowledged he had just talked to WH about a job last month https t co 45jABeralt https t co kiquwvWIWe Jim Acosta Acosta July 6 2017 So just to clarify if Acosta s definition of a fake news conference is one in which the President only takes questions from friendly reporters then isn t it fair to say that almost every Democrat news conference for the past several decades has been fake as well Perhaps Mr Acosta forgets that Obama refused to appear on Fox News for pretty much his entire presidency out of fear that he might actually be asked relevant questions He instead preferred to pal around with the serious journalists at CNN who are apparently enthralled by his jeans game which we hear is getting strong er Obama s jeans game gets strong er https t co KMTrNGHDeB pic twitter com Zp1E4JCeBj CNN Politics CNNPolitics June 28 2017 For those who missed it below is a summary of Trump s comments in Warsaw which apparently triggered Acosta Per The Hill They have been fake news for a long time Trump said They ve been covering me in a very dishonest way What CNN and others NBC is equally is bad despite the fact that I made them a fortune with The Apprentice but they forgot that He said CNN has really taken it too seriously and I think they ve hurt themselves very badly Trump went on to emphasize the importance of an honest press What we want to see in the United States is honest beautiful free but honest press We want to see fair press I think it s a very important thing he said We don t want fake news And by the way not everybody is fake news But we don t want fake news Bad thing Very bad for our country And here is the full press briefing from Poland forward to the 12 30 mark for the CNN comments
