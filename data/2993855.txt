 Just when you thought it was safe to buy Boeing stock because hell what more could go wrong Well this Late last week we warned of this weekend s Y2K moment for GPS systems Here s what s going on The rollover issue itself is caused by the fact that GPS systems count weeks using a ten bit parameter This means they start counting at week zero and reset when they hit week 1 024 The first count or GPS epoch started on January 6th 1980 and the first reset took place on August 21st 1999 That means the next one is due April 6th this year source Some experts thought that the risk is negligible while others thought this is something to which we should pay strict attention Carl Bear Bussjaeger a New Hampshire based science fiction writer Air Force veteran and former telecommunications network technician reached out to us via Twitter to say that the link between GPS timing and telecom networks is not direct Networks don t time off GPS Bussjaeger said in a tweet They time off internal master station clocks Those clocks periodically synchronize off GPS In a further conversation Bussjaeger told us he had monitored the 1999 GPS epoch rollover as part of his telecoms job and that there was not so much as a bit error on the network clocks The clocks used in telecoms can free run for days he said They re very stable GPS timing is really just a backup to the backup During an epoch rollover Bussjaeger said geolocation could glitch but only momentarily if at all A GPS unit might have to reacquire the birds satellites to determine its location but it s no worse than turning on a unit and waiting for it to acquire the satellite signal in the first place Twenty years ago we didn t have a problem he added I rather expect that clocks are better more stable now source And rightly not everyone sees it as a non event I would say it s legitimate to be concerned Brad Parkinson the retired Air Force colonel and Stanford University professor who was the lead architect of GPS told San Francisco s KPIX TVin an interview published April 2 GPS affects everything we do he said It affects timing banking cell towers airplanes ships passengers in cars everything that we can imagine If you re driving your car and it were to suddenly say you re in the middle of the Pacific Ocean be very suspicious he told KPIX TV source So basically the vibe we got from this is that nobody really knew what will happen or even if anything will happen Well now we know something has happened China Aviation Review reports that Multiple Boeing 787s in China experienced GPS 20 years rollover issue Some aircrafts have to be grounded waiting for an update Multiple Boeing 787s in China experienced GPS 20 years rollover issue Some aircrafts have to be grounded waiting for an update pic twitter com IEFF2GHIt2 And in a follow up tweet confirming that Currently about 15 787s were affected in China
