 Authored by Mac Slavo via SHTFplan com Widespread drug use and homelessness is plaguing all socialist regions of the country From San Francisco where pedestrians have to literally watch the homeless shoot up to Los Angeles where Medieval diseases have returned thanks to policies which have made it impossible for the everyday American to scrape by anymore Seattle is also committing suicide It is about the damage they inflict on themselves to be sure but also on the fabric of this place where we live This story is about a beautiful jewel that has been violated And a crisis of faith among a generation of Seattlites falling out of love with their home said KOMO s Eric Johnson in the intro to the video he helped create about the crisis Years of authoritarian socialist policies are taking their toll on America s cities It s time to say enough is enough The entire video is about an hour long but it is pretty easy to see where Seattle continues to go wrong A heavy tax burden regulations that push out businesses and a power hungry group of totalitarian sociopaths have been slowly eroding the city The decay of Western civilization can be seen up and down the entirety of the West coast Some say it s by design others disagree But the commonality is that all of the cities are being pushed into poverty by illusions and lies of socialists Calling Seattle anything other than a leftist s paradise would be inaccurate The city has all of the laws the socialists want yet it s killing itself because of it Colion Noir also has a video which shines a light on the epidemic disguising itself as a homelessness problem that is plaguing Seattle While the politicians refuse to even acknowledge the issue and instead scapegoat owners and diminish the rights of the law abiding they simultaneously turn Seattle into a perfect socialist utopia The solution The free market It s pretty simple Stop allowing people to steal your wealth and call it taxation Stop allowing people to lock you up for smoking a plant Stop allowing people to tell you whether or not you can start a business Make the government obsolete People have some sort of strange illusion that we need violence force theft and coercion to exist We do not The government is the parasite that needs a host to survive and Seattle continues to suck it s host dry like all of the other socialist cities in America Unfortunately it will probably get worse and a lot worse before it gets any better if it ever does
