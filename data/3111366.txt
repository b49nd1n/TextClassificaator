 In a bizarre tweet last week that nobody really understood singer Justin Bieber challenged Tom Cruise to a fight in the octagon for reasons unbeknownst to anybody Now it looks as though the one person that could possibly make it happen UFC President Dana White is alluding to the fact that it could actually take place I wanna challenge Tom Cruise to fight in the octagon Tom if you dont take this fight your sic scared and you will never live it down Who is willing to put on the fight danawhite Bieber said Though nobody is really sure what has started the beef between the two celebrities UFC president Dana White told TMZ last week that he s already taken phone calls from people who claim both stars are interested in the bout White said I m gonna tell you something interesting Lots of people will talk about fighting somebody in the UFC or something like that Whether it s NFL players or celebrities it happens a lot I saw it like everybody else did and didn t pay too much attention to it He continued I m not going to say any names but I m going to tell you that I got a phone call from a couple of real guys who said that they really do want to do this fight and they believe Tom Cruise would do the fight I told them I ll tell you this if that s true If that s true and everybody involved in this thing wants to do it we can talk Tom Cruise hasn t publicly responded to the viral tweet since it went out and now it seems like Justin Bieber is already trying to make excuses to back out of his challenge Bieber told TMZ It was just a random tweet I do that stuff sometimes I think he would probably whoop my ass in a fight He s got that dad strength But still Dana White hasn t given up on trying to make the fight happen
