 Scott D Sagan writes U S military officers are trained to follow orders from political authorities unless they are clearly unconstitutional The Constitution however says nothing about what to do if a president s orders are legal but also crazy This leads to bizarre situations such as the response that Admiral Scott Swift the commander of the U S Pacific Fleet gave when he was asked at a seminar at the Australian National University in July if he would launch a nuclear strike against China next week if Trump ordered him to do so The admiral should have said that the hypothetical scenario was ridiculous and left it at that Instead he answered Yes Trump s volatility has produced a hidden crisis in U S civil military relations In 1974 during the final days of Richard Nixon s presidency when Nixon had become morose and possibly unstable Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger told the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General George Brown that if Nixon gave military orders Brown should contact Schlesinger before carrying them out Schlesinger s action was extraconstitutional but nonetheless wise given the extraordinary circumstances The U S government faces similar dangers every day under Trump Mattis and senior military leaders should be prepared to ignore belligerent tweets push back against imprudent policies and resist any orders that they believe reflect impetuous or irrational decision making by the president Their oath after all is not to an individual president it is to support and defend the Constitution of the United States The Constitution s 25th Amendment lays out procedures on how to relieve an impaired president of his responsibilities If senior military leaders believe at any time that Trump is impaired they have a duty to contact Mattis who should then call for an emergency cabinet meeting to determine whether Trump is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office and thus whether to invoke the 25th Amendment One similarity with the Cuban missile crisis is that those Americans who think the United States should attack North Korea exaggerate the prospects that U S military action would succeed and underestimate the costs of a war In 1962 the CIA and the military assumed that there were no nuclear weapons in Cuba and on that basis recommended air strikes and an invasion But the intelligence assessment was wrong Well over 60 nuclear warheads gravity bombs and tactical nuclear weapons had already arrived in Cuba and one missile regiment was already operational by the time the Joint Chiefs were advising military action Any attack on Cuba would almost certainly have led to nuclear strikes on the United States and against invading U S forces Today U S intelligence finds itself once again in the dark It does not know the status of North Korea s warheads or the locations of its missiles For example when the North Koreans successfully tested an intercontinental ballistic missile in late July it came as a complete surprise to the United States and demonstrated that North Korea can now build such missiles store them take them out of storage and launch them all before the United States could react Yet U S military leaders have failed to pour cold water on the idea of a U S first strike Instead they have added fuel to the fire Consider the complaint expressed by General Joseph Dunford the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the Aspen Security Forum in July that many people have talked about the military options with words such as unimaginable Dunford insisted that to the contrary it is not unimaginable to have military options to respond to North Korean nuclear capability What s unimaginable to me is allowing a capability that would allow a nuclear weapon to land in Denver Colorado And so my job will be to develop military options to make sure that doesn t happen Dunford should have reinforced deterrence Instead he created a redline that Kim may have already crossed The military s job is to come up with options That involves thinking the unthinkable But it is also military leaders responsibility to offer brutal honesty to political leaders and the public When it comes to the current conflict with North Korea that means admitting that there are no military options that do not risk starting the most destructive war since 1945 Continue reading
