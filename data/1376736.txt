 Every year the world s richest and most powerful business executives bankers media heads and politicians sit down in some luxurious and heavily guarded venue and discuss how to shape the world in a way that maximizes profits for all involved while perpetuating a status quo that has been highly beneficial for a select few even if it means the ongoing destruction of the middle class We are talking of course about the annual and always secretive Bilderberg meeting And just like last year s meeting in Dresden the primary topic on the agenda of this year s 65th Bilderberg Meeting which starts today and ends on Sunday is one Donald Trump Ironically this year the storm around Donald Trump as the SCMP puts it is not half way around the world but just a few miles west of the White House in a conference centre in Chantilly Virginia where the embattled president will be getting his end of term grades from the people whose opinion actually matters some 130 participating Bilderbergs The secretive three day summit of the political and economic elite kicks off Thursday in heavily guarded seclusion at the Westfields Marriot a luxury hotel a short distance from the Oval Office As of Wednesday the hotel was already on lockdown and an army of landscapers have been busy planting fir trees around the perimeter to try protect coy billionaires and bashful bank bosses from prying lenses and or projectiles Perched ominously at the top of the conference agenda this year are these words The Trump Administration A progress report So is the president going to be put in detention for tweeting in class Held back a year Or told to empty his locker and leave If ever there s a place where a president could hear the words you re fired it s Bilderberg Sarcasm aside the White House was taking no chances sending along some big hitters from Team Trump to defend their boss national security adviser HR McMaster the commerce secretary Wilbur Ross and Trump s new strategist Chris Liddell curiously neither Gary Cohn nor Steven Mnuchin will be there although the controversial new Chairman of Goldman Sachs International Jose Barroso will be present Could Trump himself show up to receive his report card in person we are confident he will tweet all about it which is probably why he will never be invited Stil none other than Henry Kissinger the gravel throated kingpin of Bilderberg visited the White House a few weeks ago to discuss Russia and other things and certainly the Bilderberg conference would be the perfect opportunity for the most powerful man in the world to discuss important global issues with Trump Sarcasm aside what are among the Trump agenda items to be discussed The publicly list is as follows The US president s extraordinary chiding of NATO leaders in Brussels is sure to be first and foremost on the Bilderberg discussing panel The Bilderbergers have summoned the head of Nato Jens Stoltenberg to give feedback Stoltenberg will be leading the snappily titled session on The Transatlantic defence alliance bullets bytes and bucks He ll be joined by the Dutch minister of defence and a clutch of senior European politicians and party leaders all hoping to reset the traumatised transatlantic relationship after Trump s galumphing visit As the Guardian puts it the guest list for this year s conference is a veritable covfefe of big hitters from geopolitics from the head of the IMF Christine Lagarde to the king of Holland but perhaps the most significant name on the list is Cui Tiankai China s ambassador to the US According to the meeting s agenda China will also be discussed at a summit attended by Cui the US commerce secretary the US national security adviser two US senators the governor of Virginia two former CIA chiefs and any number of giant US investors in China including the heads of the financial services firms the Carlyle Group and KKR And for good reason as last night s PMI numbers showed the Chinese economy the global growth dynamo is finally contracting If China goes the rest of the world will follow Additionally the boss of Google Eric Schmidt who warned in January that Trump s administration will do evil things is expected to attend too The executive chairman of Alphabet Google s holding company has just come back from a trip to Beijing where he was overseeing Google AI s latest game of Go against humans He declared it a pleasure to be back in China a country that I admire a great deal It s possible three days spent chatting to the Chinese ambassador could even be good for business Several journalists are participating in this year s forum including London Evening Standard editor George Osborne and Cansu Camlibel the Washington bureau chief for Turkey s Hurriyet newspaper But per convention news outlets are not invited to cover the event There is no desired outcome no minutes are taken and no report is written the group stated Furthermore no resolutions are proposed no votes are taken and no policy statements are issued Ex deputy secretary of state William Burns and former deputy assistant secretary of defence Elaine Bunn both Obama era officials will also attend Burns the current president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace has warned that Trump risks hollowing out the ideas initiative and institutions on which US leadership and international order rest Anti globalisation protesters reportedly have descended on the location of the meeting Below is a full list of this year s participants CHAIRMAN PARTICIPANTS Natrually the secretive nature of the group has given birth to conspiracy theories Some have claimed that the Bilderberg is a group of rich and powerful kingmakers seeking to impose a one world government Whether that is true remains in the eye of the beholder however one thing is clear as the graph below shows the members are connected to virtually every important and relevant organization media outlet company and political entity in the world
