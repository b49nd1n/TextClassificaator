 The yield curve has collapsed since The Fed s hawkish September statement but bank stocks have soared as rate hike odds hit 80 and balance sheet normalization is believed to be like watching paint dry All eyes going into the FOMC Minutes were on just how transitory The Fed believed inflation s dip was many Fed officials concerned low inflation is not transitory but schizophrenically many Fed officials saw another rate hike warranted this year While the dollar was weak on the market s first skim of the minutes with algos focusing on the low inflation not only transitory the offset was the noted bizarro preview that another hike in 2017 is warranted which confirms what we suggested one month ago namely that the Fed is no longer data dependant but will continue hiking until the Fed regains control over the stock bubble Furthermore while it is clear that the Fed will keep a very close eye on inflation data into the December meeting it is unclear just how it will be able to do that as the minutes read Participants generally agreed it would be important to monitor inflation developments closely Several of them noted that interpreting the next few inflation reports would likely be complicated by the temporary run up in energy costs and in the prices of other items affected by storm related disruptions and rebuilding The next CPI print is this Friday and it will be significantly impacted by the Hurricanes to the upside will the Fed ignore it or will it focus on this as confirmation of a job well done and hike aggressively in the coming months Additional highlights include Here is how the Fed justifies kicking the can for nearly a decade Several others noted that in light of the uncertainty around their outlook for inflation their decision on whether to take such a policy action would depend importantly on whether the economic data in coming months increased their confidence that inflation was moving up toward the Committee s objective A few participants thought that additional increases in the federal funds rate should be deferred until incoming information confirmed that the low readings on inflation this year were not likely to persist and that inflation was clearly on a path toward the Committee s symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term Perhaps instead of inflation the Fed was envisioning stock prices And speaking of the Fed s explicit mention of stock prices some noted that the longer the Fed allows this bubble to grow the more pain there will be on the other side The funniest bit the Fed can t explain why two years of hiking have resulted in record easy financial conditions Some other participants however were more worried about upside risks to inflation arising from a labor market that had already reached full employment and was projected to tighten further Their concerns were heightened by the apparent easing in financial conditions that had developed since the Committee s policy normalization process was initiated in December 2015 These participants cautioned that an unduly slow pace in removing policy accommodation could result in an overshoot of the Committee s inflation objective in the medium term that would likely be costly to reverse or could lead to an intensification of financial stability risks or to other imbalances that might prove difficult to unwind Finally the usual warning by a couple of participants that the Fed is creaing a bubble Many participants viewed accommodative financial conditions which had prevailed even as the Committee raised the federal funds rate as likely to provide support for the economic expansion However a couple of those participants expressed concern that the persistence of highly accommodative financial conditions could over time pose risks to financial stability The couple will again be ignored As a reminder inflation has been on a transitory streak lower for a transitory seven months in a row now and the most recent payroll sprint was the worst since 2010 but transitory too we are sure Since the FOMC Statement on 9 20 hawkishly signaling more rate hikes and normalizing the balance sheet stocks and the dollar have jumped and gold and bonds have fallen albeit with Golden Week effects weighing heavily And rate hike odds for December have soared to 80 And while banks have outperformed the yield curve has collapsed Not what the Fed was hoping for we are sure Full FOMC Minutes below
