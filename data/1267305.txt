are not naive To short Tesla is like shorting the Government TBTF as pet projects go Werner Braun for the 21st century we call Elon His new one is NeuraLink The company was created to battle the Terminator of sorts Don t believe us Here s Musk from a recent interview Ultimately Musk fears that AI will one day overtake humanity Over the years this fear has pushed Musk to make moves that will help ensure that our artificial intelligences don t turn humans into second class citizens Here s Musk personally selling a pound of prevention to his interviewer It s best to try to prevent a negative circumstance from occurring than to wait for them to occur and then be reactive Musk Investors in Musk s current ventures may not be particularly pleased to learn that the inventor has found yet another distraction from his already ambitious and in the case of Tesla lofty and overvalued goals Here is Zerohedge s initial reaction In case revolutionizing the transportation and energy industries while colonizing Mars wasn t enough of a challenge for Elon Musk or perhaps taxpayer subsidies for Musk s ventures in those fields have dried up in his latest venture the billionaire entrepreneur now wants to merge computers with human brains to help people keep up with machines Specifically the WSJ has uncovered that Musk has launched another company called Neuralink which is pursuing what Musk calls neural lace technology which is shorthand for a brain computer interface and consists of implanting tiny brain electrodes that will one day be able upload and download thoughts Full story HERE So far Musk is self financing with profits from Tax funded Tesla the venture with potential money from Peter Thiel Our jaded guess is the Government will be buyers on the back end on this one juancarlosrs elpilot That is the aspiration to avoid AI becoming other Elon Musk elonmusk April 23 2017 Anyway good luck to him Soren K Group via Jake Anderson and theantimedia com Last week Elon Musk confirmed that his company NeuraLink is working on the development of a brain machine interface BMI For the last couple of years Musk has made no secret of his fears of artificial intelligence advancing to the point where it overtakes its human creators Musk believes that in order to safeguard the human race against a superintelligent machine apocalypse we must essentially become them cyborgs whose minds are internally augmented by advanced computer systems Along the way he believes this transition will spawn countless benefits and profitable industries for humans The concept of a brain machine interface BMI remained in the realm of science fiction until fairly recently Now there are multiple private endeavors and even a DARPA led coalition Currently there are three early BMI models motor cortex stimulation artificial ears and eyes and deep brain stimulation We are aiming to bring something to market that helps with certain severe brain injuries stroke cancer lesion congenital in about four years Musk stated But these are just the earliest manifestations of what Musk believes will soon be a thriving industry Tim Urban s post at Wait But Why make sure you have a head scratching hour before you read fleshed out some of the grittier details of what he basically refers to as the next phase of intelligent life on earth the Wizard Era Musk envisions a world in which humans are outfitted with micro sized neural lace technology When it reaches its full potential the effects will be nothing short of mind blowing We will be able to control physical objects with our thoughts have conversations between minds with no words and literally live other people s experiences including all forms of physical activity Think of it as an amalgam of virtual reality and augmented reality but without any physical devices and telepathically controlled a new digital tertiary layer of the brain Musk believes there will be therapeutic benefits as well By recoding their neural patterns people will be able to better manage psychiatric and emotional problems heighten their sensory perceptions and vastly augment their knowledge base with a cloud based memory and knowledge storage With such advanced emotional communication there will be an opportunity to instill a greater sense of empathy in people as they will actually experience what it feels like to be someone else But with great promise comes great peril Musk acknowledges there are risks involved such as mind hacking trolling and surveillance All the normal destructive tendencies of humans may follow us up the ladder As for as people reading our thoughts though Musk says not to worry People won t be able to read your thoughts you would have to will it If you don t will it it doesn t happen Just like if you don t will your mouth to talk it doesn t talk Musk believes that with OpenAI his open source non profit artificial intelligence research company he can democratize AI technology Combined with NeuraLink he believes this will lessen the existential risk posed by superintelligent machines by allowing us to keep up with the pace of augmentation Will humans embrace becoming machines Musk echoing futurist Ray Kurzweil thinks the symbiosis will be natural and that it has already started The thing that people I think don t appreciate right now is that they are already a cyborg You re already a different creature than you would have been twenty years ago or even ten years ago You re already a different creature You can see this when they do surveys of like How long do you want to be away from your phone and particularly if you re a teenager or in your 20s even a day hurts If you leave your phone behind it s like missing limb syndrome I think people they re already kind of merged with their phone and their laptop and their applications and everything There will be plenty of skeptics who believe this kind of technology is impossible or that it won t solve basic underlying problems with human civilization But if humans are hardwired to be the way they are if nature has coded them to have certain instincts and truths perhaps they can be rewired and recoded in a way that frees them from biology It certainly seems at least possible that a brain machine interface could be the game changing paradigm shift that allows humans to finally understand one another and achieve communion That s when the real advancement can begin
