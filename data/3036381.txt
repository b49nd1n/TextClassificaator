 You wouldn t know it from watching CNN or MSNBC where their amplified voices exaggerate their actual influence but Never Trump Republicans are an increasingly rare breed these days President Trump enjoys a 90 approval rating among Republicans and even Mitt Romney his biggest Republican critic in the Senate probably wouldn t describe himself as a NeverTrumper even after making all of those speeches imploring voters to reject then candidate Trump and of course being passed over for Secretary of State But on Twitter and in the fake news media the Never Trump perspective is still an important part of the conversation Which makes it even funnier when a media outlet like the Daily Caller unearths an embarrassing flip flop from one of the movement s stalwarts John Weaver a former Kasich strategist has registered as a foreign agent of JSC Technabexport on May 10 Weaver will be paid 350 000 to provide strategic advice and to lobby Congress and the Trump administration regarding a variety of issues including sanctions or other restrictions in the area of atomic nuclear energy But shortly after Trumps electoral victory in November 2016 he tweeted that Putin needed to face sanctions from Hell and insisted that Russia had interfered specifically to help Trump And his hostile tweets continued until earlier this year And Putin needs to face Sanctions from Hell so that he and his KGB cronies can t move their stolen money around the world Silly They interfered to specifically help Trump And this isn t so hard at all Need tougher sanctions etc We must have stronger tougher broader sanctions against Russia track Putin s show to world toughen alliances with Baltics Ukraine Required Special Select Cttee equal members between parties of Congress Special Prosecutor Sanctions on steroids on Putin Russia RESISTANCE Call for Independent Counsel Special Select Cttee of Congress evenly divided between parties Sanctions from hell on Putin Of course Trump ended the sanctions on Deripaksa You think Putin invested all of that just for chaos Weaver told the DC that his efforts to spare JSC Technabexport which is wholly owned by the Russian government from sanctions will be in line with US national security interests And though he acknowledged that the optics weren t great said he would continue to call out the Trump administration when he felt they were doing something wrong
