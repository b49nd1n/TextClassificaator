 Authored by Charles Hugh Smith via OfTwoMinds blog This is how they silence us your content has been secretly flagged as being unsafe i e guilty of anti Soviet thoughts poof you re gone Big Tech claims it isn t silencing skeptics dissenters and critics of the status quo but it is silencing us Here s how it s done Let s start with Twitter Twitter claims it doesn t shadow ban Setting the record straight on shadow banning which it defines as deliberately making someone s content undiscoverable to everyone except the person who posted it unbeknownst to the original poster Nice but what do we call labeling legitimate websites unsafe and banning Twitter users from retweeting links to posts on those sites This is what s happening to oftwominds com Twitter has labeled this site unsafe due to unspecified violations of the Twitter User Agreement which I have reviewed and can categorically state the oftwominds com site and posts have never violated the terms of the Agreement or the Twitter Rules except if posting several tweets that contain the URL of my current post somehow violates the Rules If bloggers can t list the URL of their original content more than once a day then the Twitter Rules are prejudicial and should be amended Note that Twitter doesn t identify or provide the user with evidence of the violation of its User Agreement that justifies the unsafe can t retweet shadow banning The process of contesting such arbitrary and opaque censorship is absurdly unsatisfactory There is no form for content owners Twitter users to contest being tossed in the unsafe can t retweet gulag users must click through a bunch of contact us screens none of which have an option for contesting being tossed in the unsafe can t retweet gulag When you give up and just send Twitter Support a report on spam i e that your own site is wrongly being labeled spam you get of course an automated response in which Twitter promises to do nothing and tell you nothing If original content that is obviously not violating the Terms of Service User Agreement can be arbitrarily banned from being retweeted without any evidence or due process how is this not censorship This is straight out of Kafka an unaccountable all powerful completely opaque bureaucracy arbitrarily bans your Twitter followers from retweeting a link to your original copyrighted content How is that not flat out censorship by a privately owned and operated entity with extra legal powers This is exactly like the Soviet Union where citizens were routinely tossed in the gulag for having anti Soviet thoughts Twitter Facebook and Google routinely hold the equivalent of extra legal administrative trials in which those accused of violating open to interpretation anti Soviet thoughts Terms of Service are not presented with evidence of their crimes nor are they given a chance in a transparent fairly administered process to contest their guilty verdict As for Facebook direct links from Facebook users to oftwominds com dropped by 90 last year over the course of a few days What could have caused this sudden collapse The only possible cause is Facebook limiting the number of people who could see my posts on their feeds If this isn t shadow banning then what do we call it other than censorship As for Google who knows how your rankings in search are jiggered We do know that having anti Soviet thoughts will get you de platformed from YouTube which not only silences you but also demonetizes your content so not only are you thrown into the censorship gulag you re stripped of your livelihood as well I have long suspected that the root of oftwominds com being censored by the Big Tech platforms is my false arrest for sedition via the scurrilously fabricated PropOrNot list that was gleefully promoted by the odious propaganda organ Washington Post promoted we should note without any journalistic investigation or even rudimentary fact checking Having been put on a list of sites deemed guilty of anti Soviet thoughts by propagandists purporting to reveal propaganda I ve been shadow banned and censored without any recourse or opportunity to contest my sentence in the Big Tech gulag This is how Big Tech silences us quietly without any evidence without any hearing without any recourse in secret extra legal proceedings where we are refused the opportunity to question our accuser and contest the evidence if any Big Tech is a privately owned and operated gulag straight out of Kafka As I have argued before the only way to dismantle this privately owned and operated gulag whose sole purpose is to maximize profits from adverts and selling user data is to turn their services into public utilities that cannot collect any data and cannot target adverts This is how they silence us your content
