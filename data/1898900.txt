 Authored by Simon Black via SovereignMan com In early March 1938 in a dusty corner of the Arabian desert Max Steineke finally had the breakthrough he was hoping for Steineke was the chief geologist for the California Arabian Standard Oil Company CASOC a venture owned by what we know today as Chevron And he hadn t had a lot of success despite years of effort Steinke was convinced that massive oil reserves were beneath the sands He just couldn t find any His prized oil well what was called Dammam 7 had been riddled with mishaps accidents and delays and it was costing the company a LOT of money Steinke was about to be shut down when finally on March 4 the well started gushing And Saudi Arabia was never the same Today oil constitutes more than half of Saudi Arabia s GDP and more than 90 of government revenue and it is the reason why Saudi Arabia is one of the world s richest nations as measured by per capita GDP But all that success also comes with risk what happens when the wells run dry Or when the oil price falls That s what they re dealing with now Saudi Arabia has been in and out of recession over the past few years due to the steep decline in oil prices And the government is desperate to raise revenue Last year the Saudi government announced Vision 2030 a long term plan to diversify its economy and reduce dependence on oil revenue The plan includes developments like a new beach resort on the Red Sea where women will be allowed to wear bikinis This is pretty forward thinking folks The government also announced that it will sell a portion of the national oil company Saudi Aramco through an IPO on a major stock exchange a move they believe will generate 100 billion for the government But none of these options fixes the short term problem Saudi Arabia needs cash Now So over the past few weeks they ve found their source theft Under the guise of a corruption crackdown the government of Saudi Arabia has arrested hundreds of its wealthiest most prominent citizens and frozen more than 1700 bank accounts The government claims that these men illegally acquired their wealth through graft and corruption Now to be fair it s true that there s an enormous amount of corruption in Saudi Arabia I lived in Riyadh years ago when I was a young intelligence officer and the corruption was obvious from Day 1 For example I remember mid level Saudi army officers explaining how they would accept bribes and kickbacks to award small contracts to local suppliers These were military commanders who were essentially stealing from their own units For us it was unthinkable But for them it was normal They discussed it openly with each other as if they were trading tips on how to steal even more Saudi billionaire Prince al Waleed one of the people who has been arrested also used to speak quite candidly about how he made his initial fortune through bribes and kickbacks So it s clear that a lot of people in Saudi Arabia have made money in illicit ways It does strike me as a farce though to see extremely corrupt bureaucrats and politicians arresting corrupt businessmen and then confining them to the very swanky Ritz Carlton hotel in Riyadh The timing is also suspect the Saudi government needs the money and cannot afford to wait for their long term plans to generate income They ve already started borrowing pretty heavily issuing close to 40 billion of debt in a single year that s a big chunk for a country with a 650 billion GDP But they know they can t keep borrowing forever hence the anti corruption purge They re now telling their captives that they ll be free to go if they voluntarily donate 70 of their wealth to the government Estimates vary for the amount of money the government will bring in through this theft the lowest amount I ve seen is 100 billion again an enormous sum in Saudi Arabia The Wall Street Journal reported that the Saudi government is targeting as much as 800 billion an amount that s larger than the entire Saudi economy To put that number in context it would be like the US government seizing 22 trillion of Americans wealth more than the value of every company listed on the New York Stock Exchange combined All of this naturally is taking place without any trial or due process They re just seizing and freezing assets If you re thinking Thank goodness I live in a free country where that would never happen think again This is really no different than Civil Asset Forfeiture in the Land of the Free the legal framework where countless federal state and local agencies have the authority to seize and freeze every asset you own without even so much as charging you with a crime They can even take your kids away I think there s a pretty big lesson here desperate governments almost invariably resort to stealing from their own citizens And that s why one step in a Plan B is to have some non reportable assets The government knows about every local bank account you ve opened They know what s in your domestic brokerage account Or what real estate you own And they can seize it all in a heartbeat So it s a good idea to have a few assets that they don t know about assets that you re not legally required to tell them about like an offshore bank account This includes things like physical cash precious metals and yes cryptocurrency You won t be worse off for having some non reportable assets especially cash Think about it it won t make a difference if there s 20 000 in your bank account or in your safe It s not like the banks pay interest anyhow But if the worst happens this emergency savings could be a life saver Do you have a Plan B
