 Alphabet employees will be just thrilled to read this Google Maps is scrambling to try and fix a glitch that sometimes directs people who are searching for an abortion clinic to pro life family planning organizations Vice reports Particularly in areas where access to abortions is seriously restricted or de facto illegal Google Maps will often unintentionally misdirect women This is most likely if the nearest abortion clinic is hundreds of miles away For example there s only one abortion clinic left in the state of North Dakota It s in the state s second largest city Fargo But if you re using Google Maps to search for an abortion clinic in North Dakota s second largest city Bismarck the clinic in Fargo oftentimes won t even show up Instead searching Google Maps for Where can I get an abortion in Bismarck North Dakota will bring up results not only for a facility that doesn t offer abortion but also for North Dakota Right to Life an organization that lobbies to end abortion That is very frustrating and certainly I would love to be able to do something about that said Tammi Kromenaker director of the Red River Women s Clinic North Dakota s only abortion provider And a small clinic like ours doesn t have the capacity to do it Nearly half of the states in the US 21 in total are considered at risk of banning abortion should Roe v Wade be overturned something that s looking increasingly probable One common ploy used by pro life organizations to confuse Google s algorithm is buying an acknowledgment that it doesn t provide abortions in small type in a difficult to find section of its website outright lies are another popular tactic Businesses can choose from a list of pre selected categories when describing themselves on Google Maps such as women s health clinic pregnancy care center or abortion clinic After a business creates or claims its listing Google sends a physical postcard to its address for authentication Paul Pennington a Google spokesman told Vice that Google sometimes uses human analysts to ferret out organizations that game its system to misrepresent themselves But it only has so much manpower and providers or non providers tactics are constantly evolving There are situations in which it can be overt misrepresentation and the business knows what they re doing I mean that s the purpose of the business Pennington said If you are picking the right business category if you are again being very clear in your website and you say We do not provide these services etc that s on us Alice Huling a lawyer for the liberal government watchdog Campaign for Accountability told the Guardian that many of these pro family organizations that mislead women on Google Maps ultimately hope to draw the pregnant women in then try to convince them to carry the pregnancy to term If they still don t feel ready to care for the child the mother can put their child up for adoption
