 It sounds almost unimaginable that anybody in the country right now would wish harm on sweet innocent Dr Anthony Fauci the gifted doctor whose pioneering work on HIV and AIDS has been credited with saving millions of lives and whose work leading the federal COVID 19 response has been lauded as a port in the storm for millions of terrified Americans And yet somebody somewhere apparently does The Hill reports that Dr Fauci has been given a security detail after receiving threats according to an anonymous person familiar with the matter Before taking his job as a top figure on the White House federal task force leading the government s effort to suppress the outbreak Dr Fauci was the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases a position he has held since 1984 Dr Fauci The doctor s absence from two White House press briefings last week sparked rumors that Trump was sidelining him after he had contradicted the president something the president has said he encourages his expert advisors to do and the PR hit was apparently enough of a concern that the doctor was swiftly returned to the lineup Asked whether he had been given security protection Dr Fauci refused to respond at Wednesday night s briefing But President Trump interjected saying everybody loves Dr Fauci while noting that the good doctor was a formidable basketball player during his younger days He doesn t need security Everybody loves him Trump said Besides that they d be in big trouble if they ever attacked him Certainly an attack on Fauci at such a sensitive time would garner very little sympathy though there are some conservatives who have blamed the doctor for allegedly trying to undermine President Trump As the Hill noted Bill Mitchell and Tom Fitton are among those who have tweeted criticisms of Dr Fauci recently However the motivations of those issuing the threats remain unclear along with their identities
